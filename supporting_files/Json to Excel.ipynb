         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The appeal was filed by the appellant (applicant) against the decision of the examining division to refuse the European patent application No 09781176.4 (hereinafter \"the application\").\n\nThe decision was based on a main request and auxiliary requests 1-5, all filed by letter dated 13 May 2016. In each request, claim 1 related to a topical composition comprising, inter alia, clinoptilolite having a mean particle size of between 100 nm and 20 mym.\n\nII. The decision cited among others the following document:\n\nD22: Prasanna H.R. et al., Comparative Analysis of Common Particle Sizing Techniques For Pharmaceutical Powders, FDA Science Day Poster, February, 2001\n\nIII. The examining division decided in particular that the main request did not comply with the requirements of Article 84 EPC, because neither the claim nor the specification specified any method for measuring the mean particle diameter. Since different methods gave different results, the skilled person would not be able to determine whether he was working within the scope of the claims or not. Furthermore, the skilled person would also get different particle size results for the same composition depending on whether he relied on the supplier data sheet or was carrying out the analysis himself.\n\nAdditionally, neither the main request nor auxiliary requests 1-5 met the requirements of Article 56 EPC, and auxiliary request 2 did not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.\n\nIV. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, the appellant filed a main request and auxiliary requests 1-5, submitted among others the following document (Annex 3), and provided arguments regarding clarity and inventive step.\n\nAnnex 3: Zeolite specifications\n\nV. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:\n\n\"A topical composition comprising\n\na) clinoptilolite, having a mean particle size of between 100 nm and 20 mym;\n\nb) a physiologically acceptable magnesium salt;\n\nc) water;\n\nd) a substantially non-cationic carrier; and\n\nwhereby\n\ne) the total molar amount of magnesium ions in the composition is higher than the total molar amount of calcium ions.\"\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 1 corresponds to claim 1 of the main request, with the additional feature that \"said composition has a negative zeta potential and is able to form an electric double layer in an aqueous medium\".\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 2 corresponds to claim 1 of auxiliary request 1, wherein component b) is replaced with \"between 0.2 and 30 w/w% of a separately added magnesium chloride hexahydrate\" .\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 3 corresponds to claim 1 of auxiliary request 2, with the additional feature that \"the minimal concentration of calcium ions in said composition is 0.04 w/w%\".\n\nClaim 1 of each of auxiliary requests 4 and 5 relates to the same preparations as in claim 1 of auxiliary requests 2 and 3, respectively, \"for use in the formation and/or recovery of the epidermal barrier in skin diseases or conditions\".\n\nVI. The Board summoned the appellant to oral proceedings.\n\nIn a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA dated 6 March 2020, the Board gave its preliminary opinion regarding the issue of clarity as well as inventive step. The Board expressed in particular the view that none of the requests fulfilled the requirement of Article 84 EPC for lack of clarity of the mean particle size parameter.\n\nVII. By letter dated 15 April 2020, the appellant announced that it would not attend the scheduled oral proceedings. The appellant made no further submissions regarding the issues identified in the Board's communication.\n\nThe oral proceedings were cancelled.\n\nVIII. The appellant's arguments regarding clarity can be summarised as follows:\n\nThe claimed particle size lay between 0.1 and 20 microns. While the different results in measuring methods might be relevant in view of very small particle sizes (below 100 nm), it was highly unlikely that the measuring methods would give a significant difference for the currently claimed range.\n\nWith respect to zeolites such as clinoptilolite, two methods were commonly known for defining particle size for pharmaceutical powders (see D22): one method was laser particle size analysis, the other was visual measurement by microscopy, a technique known as image analysis and light obscuration. Both methods were generally acknowledged to be effective in the claimed range. There was hence no indication that a skilled person would be faced by different results when choosing either one of the available measuring methods.\n\nFurthermore, a correct interpretation of Article 84 EPC was inherently linked to a correct definition of the skilled person in the particular case. The skilled person in the present case was not a producer of raw materials for pharmaceutical purposes, but a pharmacist with focus on dermatologic problems and knowledge of pharmaceutical or active ingredients used in skin care. For the formulation of the composition, he would make use of existing raw materials which are readily bought from suppliers (see for example Annex 3). Knowing that he would need a clinoptilolite with specific particle size, he would thus simply buy the appropriate form. He would thereby not be bothered with performing measurements on particle size, but trust that his supplier provides him with the accurate product.\n\nConsequently, the particle size referred to in claim 1 was clear.\n\nIX. The appellant requests that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request or, in the alternative, on the basis of one of the auxiliary requests 1-5, all filed with the statement of grounds of appeal.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. Clarity, main request\n\n1.1 Claim 1 of the main request relates to a topical composition comprising, in particular, clinoptilolite having a mean particle size of between 100nm and 20mym.\n\n1.2 Article 84 EPC requires that the claims define the matter for which protection is sought. In the case of present claim 1, where the subject-matter is defined by the mean particle size parameter, the skilled person must be able to easily and unambiguously verify whether he is working inside or outside the scope of the claim.\n\nAs noted by the examining division, neither the claims nor the description specify any method for measuring the mean particle size. It is not contested that different methods exist for measuring the particle size.\n\n1.3 The appellant argues that it is highly unlikely that the measuring methods would give a significant difference for the currently claimed range. In its opinion, there is no indication that the two commonly known methods discussed in D22 (namely laser particle size analysis and image analysis and light obscuration) would yield different results.\n\nHowever, the Board can find no support in D22 for the appellant's assertions. D22 identifies up to 5 different particle size techniques (first page), and suggests that these techniques lead to different mean size distributions (second page). The appellant did not explain why the values given by the different available techniques would not significantly differ in the claimed range of 100nm - 20mym. Consequently, it is neither demonstrated that the skilled person would know from common general knowledge which measurement method to employ, nor that all the available methods would yield substantially the same result.\n\n1.4 The appellant further argues that a skilled person was not a producer of raw materials for pharmaceutical purposes, but a pharmacist with focus on dermatologic problems and knowledge of pharmaceutical or active ingredients used in skin care. He would not have any burden knowing whether or not he is working within the claimed range, as he would simply buy the product at the appropriate particle size, thereby eliminating all confusion.\n\nThe Board does not agree. The skilled person is an expert in the technical field of the invention. In the present case, the invention is defined in claim 1 by the presence of clinoptilolite with a certain mean particle size. The skilled person, i.e. the pharmacist producing the claimed topical composition, must accordingly be familiar with techniques for the measurement of this parameter. Therefore the Board cannot accept the appellant's view that the skilled person would not be bothered with performing measurements on particle size and would merely rely on supplier information. Furthermore, the mean particle size parameter used for the definition of the subject-matter of claim 1 defines a physical characteristic of the clinoptilolite component. For the purposes of Article 84 EPC, this physical characterisation must be unambiguous and cannot be substituted with the information provided by suppliers, which could be based on any of the available measuring techniques.\n\n1.5 Thus, in the absence of indication of a method for measuring the particle size, the expression \"mean particle size\" is ambiguous. This ambiguity is compounded by the fact that, to the extent that \"mean\" refers to an average, it is not specified which type of average (volume, surface, number) is intended. The Board shares in this respect the reasoning of decisions T 1819/07, T 967/08 and T 45/10 cited in the Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 9th edition 2019, II.A.3.5.\n\n1.6 Therefore, the main request does not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC.\n\n2. Clarity - auxiliary requests 1-5\n\nClaim 1 of each of the auxiliary requests 1-5 contains the same expression \"mean particle size of between 100nm and 20mym\". Consequently, each of the auxiliary requests 1-5 also infringes Article 84 EPC.\n\n3. Since none of the appellant's requests can be allowed, the appeal has to be dismissed. The Board could take this decision in writing since the appellant announced not to attend the scheduled oral proceedings. The statement not to attend oral proceedings is treated as equivalent to a withdrawal of the request for oral proceedings (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 9th edition 2019, III.C.4.3.2 and the decisions cited there).",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The appeal filed by the applicant (appellant) lies from the examining division's decision refusing the European patent application No. 11 711 386.0. The application was filed as an international application under the PCT and published as WO 2011/117648. The title of the application is \"Disulfide stabilised antibodies and fragments thereof\".\n\nII. In the decision under appeal the examining division decided to refuse the European patent application for the sole reason that neither the main request nor  auxiliary request 1 (the sole auxiliary request) complied with the requirements of Article 56 EPC.\n\nClaim 1 of the main request read:\n\n\"1. An antibody fragment consisting of a Fab, a Fab', or a F(ab)2, wherein the light chain variable region, VL and the heavy chain variable region, VH are linked by a disulfide bond position between a pair of cysteine residues selected from the group consisting of VH37 and VL95, VH44 and VL100, VH44 and VL105, VH45 and VL87, VH55 and VL101, VH100 and VL50, VH100b and VL49, VH98 and VL46, and VH105 and VL43; and wherein the numbering is according to Kabat.\"\n\nIII. The reasoning in the decision under appeal may be summarised as follows:\n\nDocument D6, or alternatively either of documents D7 or D8, represented the closest prior-art document.\n\nThe problem formulated by the applicant - avoiding the formation of inappropriate multimeric molecules after purification by a process known as \"breathing\" - was not disclosed in the application as filed and could therefore not be accepted.\n\nEven if the problem formulated by the applicant was accepted, there was no evidence on file that it was solved by the claimed antibody fragments.\n\nThe difference between the disclosure in document D6 and the claimed subject-matter was that the VH and VL chains of the Fab fragment were \"linked by a disulphide bond position between a pair of cysteine residues selected from the group [...]\".\n\nThere was no \"special technical effect linked to that difference, as the constructs have not been tested\".\n\nThe technical problem was \"seen as the provision of an alternative Fab having modification in the variable region\".\n\nWithout the need to solve any particular problem, the claimed disulfide bond-stabilised Fab fragments had to be considered arbitrary modifications that could not involve an inventive step in view of the teachings of any of documents D12 to D14.\n\nIV. With their statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant filed a new main request along with new auxiliary requests 1 to 3 and arguments in favour of inventive step.\n\nV. The main request differed from from the main request considered in the decision under appeal (see section II above) in that (i) the expression \"selected from the group\" was inserted after \"antibody fragment\" and before \"consisting of\", (ii) a new claim 2 was added and (iii) the numbering and back-references in claims 2 and 3 were adapted to take account of the additional claim.\n\nVI. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:\n\n\"1. An antibody fragment selected from the group consisting of a Fab, a Fab', and a F(ab)2, wherein the light chain variable region, VL and the heavy chain region, VH are linked by a disulfide bond position between a pair of cysteine residues selected from the group consisting of VH37 and VL95, VH44 and VL100, VH44 and VL105, VH45 and VL87, VH55 and VL10l, VH100 and VL50, VH100b and VL49, VH98 and VL46, and VH105 and VL43; and wherein the numbering is according to Kabat.\"\n\nVII. The board issued a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA in which it inter alia provided its preliminary opinion on the issue of inventive step.\n\nLike the examining division, the board considered document D6 to be the closest prior art and considered the difference to be essentially the same as in the decision under appeal. In its decision, the examining division had taken the view that there was no special technical effect linked to that difference. The board was of the preliminary view that the experimental data filed during the examination proceedings could not support any improvement over the relevant subject-matter in the closest prior-art document, yet an effect could be acknowledged on the basis of common general knowledge in that the fragments were \"more robust\". However, for want of any comparison with the closest prior art, the board agreed with the examining division and formulated the technical problem as providing alternative Fab, Fab' or F(ab)2 antibody fragments.\n\nIn the board's preliminary view, the claimed subject-matter was an arbitrary choice from a host of possible solutions, so none of the pending requests appeared to involve an inventive step.\n\nVIII. In their reply to the board's preliminary opinion, the appellant observed, inter alia, that providing an alternative solution could also be inventive, and argued that the claimed solution did not constitute an arbitrary choice from a host of possible solutions.\n\nIX. Oral proceedings were held on 6 October 2020 in the absence of the appellant, as announced beforehand. At the end of the oral proceedings the chair announced the board's decision.\n\nX.

The appellant's arguments as far as relevant for the present decision may be summarised as follows\n\nMain request\n\nInventive step (Article 56 EPC)\n\nDocument D6 represented the closest prior art.\n\nIt described mutations primarily in the variable regions of the antibody fragments to facilitate expression in E. coli. In the heavy chain the mutations were selected from leucine, tyrosine, proline, alanine, isoleucine, asparagine, serine, valine, tryptophan and aspartic acid. In the light chain the mutations were selected from tryptophan, histidine, alanine, lysine, leucine, isoleucine, glutamic acid, asparagine and arginine (see Tables II and III).\n\nNone of the amino acids was replaced with cysteine.\n\nThe differences between the claimed subject-matter and the disclosure in document D6 were the number of mutations, i.e. two versus numerous, and the position and type of mutation, i.e. two cysteines are introduced, one in the variable heavy (VH) domain and one in the variable light (VL) domain to enable the formation of a disulfide bond.\n\nThe inventors aimed to tackle the problem of promiscuous pairing, known as \"breathing\", of the VH and VL domains between proximal Fabs and the formation of higher-order aggregates after purification and formulation. This was a new problem not identified by any prior art. The technical effect of the differences was to fix the relationship between the VH and VL domains to minimise/eliminate this phenomenon.\n\nThe technical problem starting from document D6 was to improve the physical stability of the purified antibody.\n\nThe claimed solution to this problem, i.e. the introduction of a VH-VL interchain disulfide (S-S) bond within a Fab molecule, provided a generically applicable solution which did not require any antibody sequence-specific optimisation.\n\nThere was no teaching in any of documents D7, D8, D10 and D11 to D14 that introducing an S-S bond between the VH and VL domains within a Fab was beneficial to prevent aggregation after purification.\n\nRequests\n\nXII. The appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the set of claims of the main request or, alternatively, on the basis of one of the sets of claims of the first to third auxiliary requests, all filed with the statement of grounds of appeal. The appellant also requested reimbursement of the appeal fee.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\nAdmissibility of the appeal\n\n1. The appeal complies with Articles 106 to 108 EPC and Rule 99 EPC and is admissible.\n\nMain request\n\nSubject-matter of the application\n\n2. The application provides antibody-derived, modified antigen-binding fragments (Fabs). A Fab consists of two amino acid chains, each comprising a variable domain (V) and a constant domain (C). A Fab is thus formed by a variable light chain (VL) plus a constant domain (VL-CL), and a variable heavy chain (VH) plus a constant domain (VH-CH). In many Fabs the two chains are held together by the interaction of the amino acid side chains extending between the interface of the VH and VL and CH and CL domains. In addition, the CH and CL domains are connected by an interchain S-S bond.\n\nThe invention in this case aims at stabilising the interaction of the VL-CL and VH-CH1 chains by introducing a non-naturally occurring interchain S-S bond between the VH and the VL domain.\n\nClaim construction\n\n3. The board construes the wording of claim 1 as defining subject-matter which encompasses a Fab, Fab' or F(ab)2 fragment linked by \"a\", i.e. one single, S-S bond. Such a VH/VL-stabilised Fab fragment may form part of another antibody molecule or antibody fragment (see description, page 3, paragraph 1).\n\nThe modifications need to be made within the VH/VL domains of a directly linked VH-CH1/VL-CL pair (see description, page 2, line 19, and page 9, penultimate paragraph). Therefore, the definition in the claims does not cover dual variable domain immunoglobulins (DVD-Igs), which consist of an IgG molecule with additional VH-VL pairs (normally representing additional binding entities) attached N-terminally by peptide linkers to each VH-VL pair of the IgG unit, resulting in a tetravalent binder.\n\nInventive step (Article 56 EPC)\n\nClosest prior art\n\n4. Like the examining division and the appellant, the board also considers document D6 to be the most promising starting point for assessing inventive step given that it deals with stabilising Fab molecules.\n\n5. This scientific article discloses stabilising Fabs by mutating 3 to 11 amino acids in the variable fragment (Fv) regions to facilitate expression in E. coli. In the heavy chain the mutations were selected from leucine, tyrosine, proline, alanine, isoleucine, asparagine, serine, valine, tryptophan and aspartic acid. In the light chain the mutations were selected from tryptophan, histidine, alanine, lysine, leucine, isoleucine, glutamic acid, asparagine and arginine (see Tables II and III). However, none of the amino acids was replaced with cysteine, nor was one inserted.\n\nPoor Fab expression is linked to poor intrinsic stability observed in terms of misfolding and non-functionality (see abstract). The mutations described in Tables II and III resulted in an increased melting temperature (Tm) of the Fab molecule (i.e. in a more stable Fab molecule), higher yields of expressed Fabs and higher levels of properly folded and functional Fabs (see abstract).\n\nTechnical effect and problem to be solved\n\n6. The board agrees with the appellant that the subject-matter of claim 1 differs from the disclosure in the closest prior-art document D6 on account of the number of mutations, i.e. only two versus numerous, and the position and type of mutation, i.e. two cysteines are introduced, one in each of the VH and VL domains to enable the formation of a S-S bond between those two domains. A further difference is the type of antibody fragment, i.e. claim 1 relates not only to Fab antibody fragments, but also to Fab' or F(ab)2 fragments.\n\n7. The following analysis concentrates on the Fab fragments.\n\n8. Regarding the effect of the difference, the examining division stated that \"[t]here is no special effect linked to that difference, as the constructs have not been tested\" (emphasis by the examining division).\n\nThe examining division therefore formulated the technical problem \"as the provision of an alternative Fab having modification in the variable region\".\n\n9. On the basis of the application, the appellant formulated the technical effect linked to the differences (see point 6 above) as fixing the relationship between the VH and VL domains so as to minimise/eliminate promiscuous pairing of the variable domains and the consequent formation of aggregates.\n\nConsequently, the technical problem was formulated as \"to improve the physical stability of the purified antibody\".\n\n10. With regard to the examining division's reasoning that no special technical effect could be acknowledged because \"the constructs have not been tested\", the board notes that any kind of evidence, i.e. not necessarily tests, can be offered for substantiating the effect of the difference.\n\n11. With regard to the appellant's line of reasoning, the board notes that when formulating the technical problem only those effects for which there is evidence that they are achieved vis-à-vis the closest prior art are taken into consideration (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 9th edition, 2019, I.D.4.1, page 188, paragraph 5).\n\nThe board has seen no evidence of any kind pointing to the fact that the stability of the claimed Fab molecules with an engineered S-S bond linking the VH and VL domains is improved compared with that of the Fab disclosed in document D6.\n\nHence, the effect and the problem cannot be formulated as suggested by the appellant.\n\n12. In the board's view, one effect that can be recognised as being achieved by the differences set out in point 6 above is that stated in the application on page 1, lines 16 and 17, namely that the modifications make the antibody fragments \"more robust\". This effect can be accepted on the basis of common general knowledge about the function of S-S bonds in proteins.\n\n13. For want of any evidence regarding the robustness compared with antibody fragments disclosed in document D6, the objective technical problem to be solved is to be formulated as providing alternative stabilised Fab molecules.\n\nObviousness\n\n14. The question to be answered when assessing the obviousness of the claimed subject-matter is whether or not the skilled person, starting from document D6 and faced with the problem of providing alternative stabilised Fab molecules, would have modified the approach disclosed in document D6 such as to arrive at the claimed subject-matter.\n\n15. To answer this question, documents D7 and D11 to D14 were considered most relevant.\n\n16. Document D7, a scientific article, analyses domain interactions in Fab molecules and provides a comparative evaluation of the scFv and the Fab format engineered with V-domains of different stabilities.\n\n17. Pages 774, right-hand column, paragraph 2 states: \"Early studies of the stability of a particular Fab fragment, compared to that of the light chain alone, showed a significant stabilization of the light chain through interactions with the heavy chain. Within the context of a disulfide-linked Fab fragment, the VHVL heterodimer and the CHCL heterodimer were found to behave as two distinct folding units. The CHCL heterodimer was found to be significantly more stable than the VHVL heterodimer for the particular antibody under study.\"\n\nAccording to page 779, left-hand column, paragraph 3, both the CH and the CL domains are required in order to further stabilise both V- and C-domains within a Fab.\n\nPage 781, right-hand column, paragraph 2 states that \"[...] the interchain disulfide bond at the C-terminal ends of the constant domains plays an important role in the stabilization of the Fab fragment (Figure 5) [...]\".\n\nThe authors of document D7 conclude on page 786, left-hand column, last paragraph, that:\n\n\"Especially weak variable domains experience a considerable stabilization to make them more usable for practical application. This effect is mostly due to kinetic stabilization provided by the CHCL heterodimer and especially the disulfide-linked CHCL**(SS) heterodimer. At equilibrium, the stabilizing effect is smaller. Conversely, with very stable variable domains, constant domains without an intradomain disulfide bond become a liability. This is remedied only by the re-introduction of the interdomain disulfide bond. The question of which format is \"better\", Fab fragment or scFv fragment, does not have a unique answer, but depends on the stability of the variable domains involved, as well as on the importance that is placed on production yields, as Fab fragments containing the interdomain disulfide bond tend to give lower yields in bacterial production than either Fab fragments without disulfide bond or scFv fragments.\"\n\n18. Thus, document D7 teaches that one of the key elements in stabilising the interaction of the two chains in a Fab molecule is the S-S bond between the CH-CL chains. The document does not teach introducing a further S-S bond, nor does it suggest introducing any such bond in the variable domains. Moreover, introducing S-S bonds is also reported to have some negative effects.\n\n19. Review article D11 describes stability engineering of single-chain Fvs (scFv), stating that one of the most widely used strategies to stabilise the VH-VL interface is to engineer an interface S-S bond into the contact surface between the two domains (see page 1001, right-hand column, last paragraph). In this context it is also explained that the most frequently used modification is the combination of introducing cysteines in positions H44 and L100 (see page 1001, left-hand column, lines 3 et seq.). However, document D11 also reports some problems associated with an engineered S-S bond as a means for stabilising the VH-VL interface (see page 1001, right-hand column, paragraph 3).\n\n20. Document D12 summarises the design strategy, construction and production of various S-S-stabilised Fv antibody fragments (dsFv) and dsFv-fusion proteins. It also discusses the biochemical features of dsFvs in comparison with scFvs, the effect of S-S stabilisation on Fv binding and activity, and various applications of dsFvs and dsFv-immunotoxins for tumour imaging and treating solid tumours in animal models (see abstract and Figures 1 and 4).\n\n21. Document D13 discloses S-S-stabilised Fv fragments in which an S-S bond has been introduced at one of the positions VH44-VL100, VH44-VL105 and VH111-VL48. This was shown to stabilise various Fvs while at the same time retaining full binding capacity and specificity. Recombinant immunotoxins comprising S-S-stabilised Fvs are reported to be indistinguishable in binding and specificity from their scFv-immunotoxin counterparts, and are more stable in human serum and more resistant to thermal and chemical denaturation than the scFv immunotoxin (see abstract and Figure 2).\n\n22. Document D14 reports that Fv fragments are usually stabilised by being produced as an scFv in which the two chains are linked by means of a short polypeptide linker. An alternative strategy is to connect the two chains by means of an interchain S-S bond. Two sites identified for introducing the S-S bond are VH44-VL100 and VH105-VL43. Immunotoxins comprising the dsFv are found to be just as active as the scFv and considerably more stable. The authors expect the S-S bond at these sites to stabilise the Fv fragment of most antibodies and the antigen-specific portion of the T-cell receptors, which are homologous (see abstract).\n\n23. In view of the above, documents D11 to D14 all relate to stabilising Fv and scFv - and not Fab - fragments by introducing an interdomain S-S bond at some of the claimed positions as an alternative to the peptide linker in an scFv molecule (see e.g. document D11, page 1001, left-hand column, last paragraph to right-hand column, paragraph 3).\n\nNone of these documents prompts the skilled person to introduce a VH-VL interdomain S-S bond into Fabs in order to increase their stability.\n\n24. The question is whether a skilled person would have transferred the knowledge gained with S-S-stabilised Fv fragments to Fab molecules.\n\n25. In this regard the board notes that the authors of document D7 were aware of Fvs stabilised by a disulphide bond - as evidenced by their reference 60 (document D11 in these proceedings). Nevertheless, after having performed extensive analyses of the domain interactions within Fab molecules, the authors suggest re-introducing the S-S bond at the CH-CL interface - not within the variable regions (see page 786, left-hand column, last paragraph).\n\n26. As such, the board considers that, in the light of documents D7 and D11 to D14, the skilled person faced with the problem of providing alternative stabilised antibodies would not have modified the teaching in document D6 such as to arrive at the embodiment of the claimed invention being analysed here, i.e. Fab fragments (see point 7 above).\n\n27. The board's reasoning above with respect to Fab fragments also applies to the claimed Fab' and F(ab)2 fragments, since the Fab unit represents the essential component of both of these antibody fragments too.\n\n28. Consequently, the subject-matter of claim 1 involves an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).\n\nReimbursement of the appeal fee\n\n29. In its letter of 9 March 2020, the appellant made the following request for the first time in the appeal proceedings and without any further explanation: \"We also request reimbursement of the appeal fee\" (see page 7, last sentence before the signature).\n\n30. It has been established by the jurisprudence in relation to claim requests, that any claim requests filed without substantiation should not be deemed submitted until the date they are substantiated unless the reasons for their filing are self-explanatory (see decision T 1732/10, point 1.5 followed by many other decisions; see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 9th edition 2019, V.A.4.12.5). Given that the purpose of substantiation is so that a board understands why a request has been submitted, the board considers that the case law referred to above is also applicable to requests for reimbursement of the appeal fee.\n\n31. Since, in the case in hand, the request for reimbursement of the appeal fee was not substantiated either when it was made or later, and the reasons for its filing were not self-explanatory, this request does not form part of these appeal proceedings. As a consequence, the board need not decide on the matter.",
         "Order, For these reasons it is decided that:, 1. The decision under appeal is set aside., 2. The case is remitted to the examining division for further prosecution.",
         "the application is deemed to be withdrawn",

März 2021, das Europäische Patent Nr. 2 438 903 unter Artikel 101(3) a) EPÜ in geänderter Form aufrechtzuerhalten.\n\nII. Von der Patentinhaberin wurde am 22. Dezember 2020 zudem gegen die Kurzmitteilung der Einspruchsabteilung vom 21. Dezember 2020 Beschwerde eingereicht. In der Kurzmitteilung wurde der Antrag der Patentinhaberin auf Durchführung einer mündlichen Verhandlung vor der Einspruchsabteilung in den Räumlichkeiten des Europäischen Patentamts abgelehnt.\n\nIII. Die beiden Beschwerden wurden unter einer gemeinsamen Beschwerdenummer zusammengefasst.\n\nIV. Die Patentinhaberin (Beschwerdegegnerin) hat ihre Beschwerde gegen die Kurzmitteilung der Einspruchsabteilung mit Schriftsatz vom 12. Juni 2023 zurückgenommen. Eine diesbezügliche Entscheidung erübrigt sich daher.\n\nDie vorliegende Entscheidung bezieht sich auf die vorstehend unter Punkt I. genannten Beschwerden der Einsprechenden 1 bis 3.\n\nV. Im Einspruchsverfahren wurde das Patent unter Artikel 100 a) EPÜ wegen mangelnder Neuheit (Artikel 54 EPÜ) und mangelnder erfinderischer Tätigkeit (Artikel 56 EPÜ), unter Artikel 100 b) wegen mangelnder Ausführbarkeit, sowie Artikel 100 c) wegen unzulässiger Änderungen angegriffen.\n\nVI. Die Einspruchsabteilung kam in ihrer Entscheidung zu dem Ergebnis, dass die im erteilten Patent beanspruchte Erfindung ausreichend offenbart werde. Auch seien die durchgeführten Änderungen durch die ursprünglich eingereichte Anmeldung gestützt. Die basierend auf Artikel 100 b) und c) EPÜ vorgebrachten Einspruchsgründe überzeugten daher nicht. Des Weiteren sei der beanspruchte Gegenstand neu (Artikel 100 a) und 54 EPÜ), beruhe aber nicht auf einer erfinderischen Tätigkeit. Vielmehr werde dem Fachmann die Bereitstellung der beanspruchten kosmetischen Zubereitung ausgehend von den Dokumenten D2 oder D15 nahegelegt (Artikel 100 a) und 56 EPÜ).\n\nAnspruch 1 des Hilfsantrags 1 erfülle hingegen auch die Erfordernisse des Artikels 56 EPÜ.\n\nVII. Die Beschwerdeführerinnen 1 bis 3 (Einsprechenden 1 bis 3) begründeten ihre Beschwerden damit, dass die Entscheidung der Einspruchsabteilung dahingehend fehlerhaft sei, der Bereitstellung der Zubereitung gemäß Anspruch 1 des Hilfsantrags 1 eine erfinderische Tätigkeit zuzuerkennen. Auch erfülle der Antrag, entgegen der Auffassung der Einspruchsabteilung, nicht die Erfordernisse des Artikels 123(2) EPÜ.\n\nVIII. In einer Mitteilung gemäß Artikel 15(1) VOBK informierte die Kammer die Parteien über ihre vorläufige Auffassung der Rechts- und Sachlage.\n\nIX. In der vorliegenden Entscheidung wird auf die folgenden Dokumente verwiesen:\n\nD2:    DE 10 2007 028 497 A1\n\nD15:   EP 1 310 237 A1\n\nD23:   \"In Vivo Determination of Sun Protection\",\n\nVersuchsbericht der Beschwerdegegnerin,\n\nvorgelegt im Prüfungsverfahren am\n\n21.

Anspruch 1 des vorliegenden Hauptantrags (Hilfsantrag 1 der angefochtenen Entscheidung) hat den folgenden Wortlaut:\n\n\"Kosmetische Zubereitung in Form einer Öl-in-Wasser-Emulsion (O/W-Emulsion), enthaltend eine UV-Filterkombination aus\n\na) 4-(tert.-Butyl)-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethan,\n\nb) 5 bis 9 Gew.-% bezogen auf das Gesamtgewicht der Zubereitung an 2-Ethylhexyl-2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylat,\n\nc) 2-Phenylbenzimidazol-5-sulfonsäure und/oder deren Salze,\n\nd) 2,4-Bis-{[4-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-2-hydroxy]-phenyl}-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazin,\n\nwobei die Zubereitung frei ist von Parabenen, Phenoxyethanol, 3-Iodo-2-propynylbutylcarbamat und Methylisothiazolinon,\n\ndadurch gekennzeichnet, dass die Zubereitung von 6 bis 10 Gew.-% Ethanol, bezogen auf das Gesamtgewicht der Zubereitung, enthält.\"\n\nXI. Anspruch 1 des vorliegenden Hilfsantrags 2 hat den folgenden Wortlaut:\n\n\"Verwendung einer Kombination aus\n\na) 4-(tert.-Butyl)-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethan,\n\nb) 5 bis 9 Gew.-% bezogen auf das Gesamtgewicht der Zubereitung an 2-Ethylhexyl-2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylat,\n\nc) 2-Phenylbenzimidazol-5-sulfonsäure und/oder deren Salze,\n\nd) 2,4-Bis-([4-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-2-hydroxy]-phenyl}-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazin,\n\nzur Herstellung wasserfester und/oder konservierungsmittelfreier kosmetischer Zubereitungen in Form einer Öl-in-Wasser-Emulsion (O/W-Emulsion), wobei die Zubereitung frei ist von Parabenen, Phenoxyethanol, 3-Iodo-2-propynylbutylcarbamat und Methylisothiazolinon (konservierungsmittelfrei), dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass die Zubereitung von 2 bis 12 Gew.-% Ethanol, bezogen auf das Gesamtgewicht der Zubereitung, enthält.\"\n\nXII. Anspruch 1 des vorliegenden Hilfsantrags 3 hat den folgenden Wortlaut:\n\n\"Verwendung einer kosmetischen Zubereitung in Form einer Öl-in-Wasser-Emulsion (O/W-Emulsion), enthaltend eine UV-Filterkombination aus\n\na) 4-(tert.-Butyl)-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethan,\n\nb) 5 bis 9 Gew.-% bezogen auf das Gesamtgewicht der Zubereitung an 2-Ethylhexyl-2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylat,\n\nc) 2-Phenylbenzimidazol-5-sulfonsäure und/oder deren Salze,\n\nd) 2,4-Bis-{[4-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-2-hydroxy]-phenyl)-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazin,\n\nwobei die Zubereitung frei ist von Parabenen, Phenoxyethanol, 3-Iodo-2- propynylbutylcarbamat und Methylisothiazolinon (konservierungsmittelfrei), dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass die Zubereitung von 2 bis 12 Gew.-% Ethanol, bezogen auf das Gesamtgewicht der Zubereitung, enthält, als wasserfeste kosmetische Zubereitung.\"\n\nXIII. In ihren Beschwerdebegründungen und im weiteren Verfahren brachten die Beschwerdeführerinnen in Bezug auf den für die vorliegende Entscheidung relevanten Punkt der erfinderischen Tätigkeit im Wesentlichen folgendes vor:\n\nDas einzige Unterscheidungsmerkmal der beanspruchten Zubereitung gegenüber dem nächstliegenden Stand der Technik (Dokument D2 oder D15), i.e. der höhere Gehalt an Ethanol, ruft keine technische Wirkung hervor, insbesondere keine Verbesserung der Wasserbeständigkeit. Eine derartige technische Wirkung ist den vorgelegten Versuchen, weder gemäß Streitpatent, noch gemäß der Dokumente D43, D23 oder D26, nicht zu entnehmen. Die technische Aufgabe der Bereitstellung einer alternativen kosmetischen Sonnenschutz-Zubereitung wird durch die Bereitstellung der beanspruchten Zubereitung in naheliegender Weise gelöst, da der Fachmann durch routinemäßiges Vorgehen auch den Gehalt an Ethanol in bekannten Zubereitungen variiert. Selbst im Dokument D2 selbst, als möglichem nächstliegenden Stand der Technik, wird dem Fachmann zudem ein innerhalb des anspruchsgemäßen Bereichs liegender Wert offenbart.\n\nAuch muss die Frage der erfinderischen Tätigkeit ausgehend von der Offenbarung des Dokuments D5 beurteilt werden.\n\nXIV. In ihrer Erwiderung auf die Beschwerdebegründung und im weiteren Verfahren brachte die Beschwerdegegnerin in Bezug auf den für die vorliegende Entscheidung relevanten Punkt der erfinderischen Tätigkeit im Wesentlichen folgendes vor:\n\nDokument D2 stellt den nächstliegenden Stand der Technik dar. Die im Hauptantrag beanspruchte kosmetische Zubereitung in Form einer Öl-in-Wasser Emulsion unterscheidet sich von Zubereitungen gemäß D2 (insbesondere) durch die darin enthaltene Menge an Ethanol. Dies führt zu einer Verbesserung der Wasserbeständigkeit der erhaltenen Sonnenschutz-Zubereitung. Nachweise einer technischen Wirkung sind sowohl der Patentschrift selbst, als auch den Dokumenten D43 sowie D23 und D26 zu entnehmen. Die gelöste technische Aufgabe liegt somit in der Bereitstellung einer kosmetischen Zubereitung mit erhöhter Wasserbeständigkeit. Da dem Fachmann der Zusammenhang zwischen dem Gehalt an Ethanol und der dadurch hervorgerufenen höheren Wasserbeständigkeit aus dem vorliegenden Stand der Technik nicht bekannt ist, liegt erfinderische Tätigkeit vor.\n\nXV. Am 10. August 2023 fand eine mündliche Verhandlung statt, an deren Ende die Entscheidung verkündet wurde.\n\nXVI. Die Schlussanträge der Parteien sind wie folgt:\n\nDie Beschwerdeführerinnen 1, 2 und 3 (Einsprechende 1, 2 und 3) beantragen die Aufhebung der angefochtenen Entscheidung und den Widerruf des europäischen Patents Nr. 2 438 903.\n\nDie Beschwerdegegnerin (Patentinhaberin) beantragt die Zurückweisung der Beschwerde (und damit die Aufrechterhaltung des Patents auf der Grundlage des im Einspruchsverfahren eingereichten Hilfsantrags 1), hilfsweise die Aufrechterhaltung des Patents auf der Grundlage eines der im Einspruchsverfahren eingereichten Hilfsanträge 2 und 3.",

In der angefochtenen Entscheidung hat die Einspruchsabteilung das Vorliegen einer erfinderischen Tätigkeit ausgehend von der technischen Lehre der Dokumente D2 bzw. D15 bejaht. Sie gründete ihre Entscheidung darauf, dass durch den höheren Anteil an Ethanol in der beanspruchten Zubereitung von 6 bis 10 Gew.-% gegenüber 3 Gew.-% (Dokument D2) bzw. 5 Gew.-% (D15), und dem gleichzeitigen Verzicht auf Parabene und Phenoxyethynol als Konservierungsmittel, eine erhöhte Wasserfestigkeit hervorgerufen werde. Dies werde durch die im Streitpatent offenbarten Vergleichsversuche gezeigt. Da dieser Zusammenhang aus dem Stand der Technik nicht bekannt sei, liege erfinderische Tätigkeit vor.\n\n3. Strittig zwischen den Parteien war insbesondere, ob durch die anspruchsgemäße Menge an Ethanol in der beanspruchten Zubereitung eine Verbesserung der Wasserbeständigkeit hervorgerufen wird, oder nicht. Entsprechend sei die technische Aufgabe entweder in der Bereitstellung einer alternativen (Beschwerdeführerinnen), oder aber einer hinsichtlich Wasserbeständigkeit verbesserten (Beschwerdegegnerin) kosmetischen Zubereitung zu sehen. Auch hinsichtlich zusätzlicher Unterscheidungsmerkmale waren sich die Parteien uneinig.\n\n4. Die Kammer folgt der Argumentation der Beschwerdeführerinnen. Die Gründe hierfür sind wie folgt:\n\nDas Streitpatent\n\n5. Das Streitpatent beschäftigt sich mit Sonnenschutzmitteln. Diese sollen gegenüber herkömmlichen Sonnenschutzmitteln einen geringeren Gehalt an Konservierungsmitteln und eine höhere Wasserfestigkeit aufweisen (siehe die Absätze [0001], [0005] und [0007]). Gemäß Anspruch 1 wird hierzu eine kosmetische Zubereitung in Form einer Öl-in-Wasser-Emulsion vorgeschlagen, die eine aus den vier Bestandteilen a) bis d) bestehende UV-Filterkombination enthält. Zudem enthält sie ausgewählte Konservierungsmittel nicht, und sie weist einen Gehalt von 6 bis 10 Gew.-% Ethanol auf.\n\nNächstliegender Stand der Technik\n\n6. Dokument D2 offenbart kosmetische Sonnenschutzmittel. Diese liegen vorzugsweise als O/W-Emulsion vor und sollen sich unter anderem durch erhöhte Wasserfestigkeit auszeichnen (siehe die Absätze [0004], [0011], [0015] und [0073]). Das Dokument offenbart Beispiele mit Zubereitungen, die die vier UV-Filterbestandteile gemäß Anspruch 1 des Hauptantrags enthalten. Insbesondere eignet sich, wie auch von den Parteien vorgeschlagen, das Beispiel \"Emulsion O\" auf den Seiten 13 und 14 des Dokuments als Ausgangspunkt für die Beurteilung der erfinderischen Tätigkeit.\n\n7. Da, wie nachstehend dargelegt, die Bereitstellung der gemäß Streitpatent beanspruchten Zubereitungen ausgehend von Dokument D2 als nächstliegendem Stand der Technik nicht auf einer erfinderischen Tätigkeit beruht, ist für die vorliegende Entscheidung eine Beurteilung ausgehend von weiteren Dokumenten nicht entscheidend. Dies trifft insbesondere auch deshalb zu, weil die unterliegende Beschwerdegegnerin der Argumentation ausgehend von Dokument D2 als nächstliegendem Stand der Technik den Vorzug gab.\n\nUnterscheidungsmerkmal\n\n8. Im Beispiel \"Emulsion O\" des Dokuments D2 wird eine Zubereitung in Form einer O/W-Emulsion offenbart, die eine Filterkombination aus den Komponenten a) bis d) gemäß Anspruch 1 des Hauptantrags aufweist (siehe die Tabelle der Seiten 13 und 14, insbesondere die Zeilen 15, 16, 20 und 22 der Seite 14).\n\nDies war unstrittig zwischen den Parteien.\n\n9. Die Zubereitung \"Emulsion O\" enthält zudem drei Anteile \"Alkohol\". Der Anteil an den Bestandteilen \"Parfüm, Konservierungsmittel\" wird nicht spezifiziert (\"q.s.\").\n\n10. Die Kammer schließt sich der Auffassung der Einspruchsabteilung und der Beschwerdeführerinnen dahingehend an, dass die \"Emulsion O\" 3 Gew.-% Alkohol in Form von Ethanol enthält. In der Zubereitung handelt es sich um eine konkrete Zusammensetzung. Daher wird nicht ein beliebiger, lediglich generisch definierter weiterer Alkohol enthalten sein, sondern insbesondere das im Absatz [0048] als vorzugsweise genannte Ethanol. Dies wurde im Verlauf der mündlichen Verhandlung von der Beschwerdegegnerin auch nicht mehr bestritten.\n\n11. Die Kammer schließt sich der Auffassung der Beschwerdeführerinnen auch dahingehend an, dass die Zubereitung \"Emulsion O\" die im Anspruch 1 des Hauptantrags ausgenommenen Konservierungsmittel nicht enthält. Parfüme und Konservierungsmittel können zwar in der Zubereitung \"Emulsion O\" vorhanden sein, jedoch lediglich falls dies erforderlich ist (q.s., quantum santis). Gemäß Absatz [0040] des Dokuments lassen sich vorteilhafte Zubereitungen erhalten, wenn diese beispielsweise die anspruchsgemäß ausgenommenen Konservierungsstoffe Parabene oder Phenoxyethanol enthalten. Da dies jedoch nicht für alle offenbarten Zubereitungen gilt, sondern nur für erfindungsgemäß vorteilhafte, also bevorzugte, kann nicht davon ausgegangen werden, dass die \"Emulsion O\" diese Bestandteile zwingend enthält.\n\n12. Im Ergebnis unterscheidet sich die im Anspruch 1 des Hauptantrags beanspruchte Zubereitung daher von der Zubereitung gemäß \"Emulsion O\" des Dokuments D2 lediglich darin, dass sie von 6 bis 10 Gew.-% Ethanol enthält, statt 3 Gew.-%.\n\nObjektive technische Aufgabe\n\n13. Im Streitpatent werden in der Tabelle im Absatz [0044] zwei Beispiele von Rezepturen \"Produkt 1\" und \"Produkt 2\" offenbart. Beide Zubereitungen weisen einen Gehalt an Ethanol innerhalb des beanspruchten Bereichs von 6 bis 10 Gew.-% auf. Diese Beispiele können somit keine technische Wirkung belegen, die auf dem Unterscheidungsmerkmal eines gegenüber Dokument D2 erhöhten Ethanolgehalts beruhen.\n\n14. Die Patentinhaberin bezog sich auch auf das von der Beschwerdeführerin 3 vorgelegte Dokument D43. Dieses Dokument zeige, im Widerspruch zu den Ausführungen der Beschwerdeführerinnen, dass mit der Auswahl des anspruchsgemäßen Bereichs an Ethanol eine Verbesserung der Wasserbeständigkeit der untersuchten Zubereitungen erzielt werde.\n\n15. Die Kammer folgt diesen Ausführungen nicht.\n\nIm Dokument D43 werden Zubereitungen untersucht, die denen der \"Emulsion O\" des Dokuments D2 nachgestellt sind. Die drei in Tabelle 1 offenbarten Zubereitungen unterscheiden sich lediglich im Gehalt an Ethanol (siehe letzte Zeile der Tabelle: 3, 8 und 11 Gew.-%).\n\nDies war unstrittig.\n\nIm Absatz \"III. Results\" des Dokuments D43 wird angegeben, dass sich die drei getesteten Zubereitungen in ihrer Wasserbeständigkeit zunächst zwar augenscheinlich unterscheiden (44% vs. 47% vs. 43%). Allerdings wird in der ersten Zeile des Absatzes darauf verwiesen, dass die Ergebnisse lediglich mit einem Vertrauensintervall von 90% angegeben wurden. Hierzu wurde von der Beschwerdeführerin-Einsprechenden 3 vorgebracht, dass diese Genauigkeit nicht zur Unterscheidung der erhaltenen Werte der Wasserbeständigkeit ausreiche. Dies wird auch im Dokument D43 selbst durch die im Hinblick auf die Resultate gemachte Feststellung zum Ausdruck gebracht, dass der Gehalt an Ethanol nicht zu einer erhöhten Wasserfestigkeit führe, und daher keine auf dem Ethanolgehalt beruhende technische Wirkung gezeigt sei.\n\nDie Ergebnisse des Dokuments D43 zeigen daher ebenfalls nicht, dass innerhalb der untersuchten Zubereitungen eine Veränderung des Anteils an Ethanol zwischen 3 und 8 Gew.-% zu einer Verbesserung der Wasserbeständigkeit führt.\n\n16. Von der Beschwerdegegnerin wurde auch auf die Dokumente D23 und D26 verwiesen.\n\nAuch diese Dokumente sind jedoch nicht geeignet, um eine auf das genannte Unterscheidungsmerkmal zurückzuführende technische Wirkung zu belegen.\n\nDie Dokumente D23 und D26 offenbaren jeweils zwei Beispiele, die sich jedoch nicht im Alkoholgehalt unterscheiden. Die Zubereitungen gemäß Dokument D23 enthalten beide jeweils 2 Gew.-% Ethanol, die gemäß Dokument D26 enthalten beide jeweils 5 Gew.-%. Die beobachteten Unterschiede in der Wasserfestigkeit (57,60 und 78,80% für die beiden Zubereitungen gemäß Dokument D23; 134,49 und 142,34% gemäß Dokument D26) können daher nicht auf einen unterschiedlichen Gehalt an Ethanol zurückgeführt werden.\n\n17. Somit liegen keine glaubhaften Nachweise vor, dass durch den unterschiedlichen Gehalt an Ethanol eine besondere technische Wirkung hervorgerufen wird.\n\n18. Die objektive technische Aufgabe liegt deshalb in der Bereitstellung einer zu der im Dokument D2 offenbarten Zubereitung \"Emulsion O\" alternativen kosmetischen Zubereitung, die sich als Sonnenschutzmittel eignet.\n\nVorgeschlagene Lösung\n\n19. Gemäß Anspruch 1 des vorliegenden Hauptantrags wird zur Lösung dieser Aufgabe eine kosmetische Zubereitung in Form einer Öl-in-Wasser-Emulsion vorgeschlagen, die neben einer UV-Filterkombination aus den vier Verbindungen a) bis d) Ethanol - insbesondere in einer Menge von 6 bis 10 Gew.-% bezogen auf das Gesamtgewicht der Zubereitung - enthält.\n\nDie Kammer ist davon überzeugt, dass die gestellte technische Aufgabe durch die beanspruchte Zubereitung gelöst wird.\n\nNaheliegen der vorgeschlagenen Lösung\n\n20. Im Dokument D2 wird der Gehalt an Alkohol in den offenbarten Zubereitungen nicht als kritisch dargestellt (siehe den Absatz [0048]). Zudem wird dem Fachmann im Absatz [0080] des Dokuments selbst bereits eine Zubereitung offenbart, die einen Alkoholanteil von 8,0 Gew.-% enthält. Der Fachmann wird daher, auf der Suche nach einer Lösung der genannten technischen Aufgabe der Bereitstellung einer alternativen kosmetischen Sonnenschutz-Zubereitung, die Zubereitung \"Emulsion O\" im Rahmen routinemäßigen Vorgehens beispielsweise dahingehend ändern, dass sie einen leicht höheren Ethanolgehalt, wie den im Absatz [0080] offenbarten Gehalt von 8,0 Gew.-%, aufweist. Die Bereitstellung der beanspruchten Zubereitung erfordert somit keine erfinderische Tätigkeit.\n\nErgebnis zum Hauptantrag\n\n21. Da die Bereitstellung der beanspruchten kosmetischen Zubereitung nicht auf einer erfinderischen Tätigkeit beruht, und der Hauptantrag deshalb den Erfordernissenn des Artikels 56 EPÜ nicht genügt, ist er bereits aus diesem Grund nicht gewährbar. Eine Erörterung weiterer von den Beschwerdeführerinnen vorgebrachter Einwände erübrigt sich.\n\nHilfsanträge\n\n22. Von der Beschwerdegegnerin wurden die bereits im Einspruchsverfahren vorgelegten Hilfsanträge 2 und 3 weiterverfolgt.\n\n23. Anspruch 1 des Hilfsantrags 2 bezieht sich auf die Verwendung einer gemäß vorliegendem Hauptantrag als UV-Filterkombination bezeichneten Kombination der vier Verbindungen a) bis d) zur Herstellung wasserfester und/oder konservierungsmittelfreier kosmetischer Zubereitungen in Form einer O/W-Emulsion. Die Zubereitung ist ebenfalls frei von den im Anspruch 1 des Hauptantrags genannten Konservierungsmitteln. Sie enthält jedoch 2 bis 12 Gew.-% Ethanol, im Gegensatz zur Zubereitung gemäß Anspruch 1 des Hauptantrags mit 6 bis 10 Gew.-%.\n\n24. Anspruch 1 des Hilfsantrags 3 bezieht sich auf die Verwendung einer kosmetischen Zubereitung in Form einer O/W-Emulsion als wasserfeste kosmetische Zubereitung. Die Zubereitung ist definiert wie die Zubereitung gemäß Anspruch 1 des Hauptantrags, wobei sie jedoch von 2 bis 12 Gew.-% Ethanol, statt lediglich von 6 bis 10 Gew.-%, enthält.\n\n25. Von der Beschwerdegegnerin wurden keine über ihr Vorbringen bezüglich des Hauptantrags hinausgehenden Argumente vorgebracht, um eine erfinderische Tätigkeit zu belegen. Vielmehr hat sie im Verlauf der mündlichen Verhandlung bestätigt, dass durch die Hilfsanträge hinsichtlich erfinderischer Tätigkeit kein neuer Sachverhalt entstehe.\n\n26. Die Kammer stellt fest, dass der in den Hilfsanträgen 2 und 3 beanspruchte Gegenstand aus denselben Gründen wie Anspruch 1 des Hauptantrags ausgehend von der Offenbarung des Dokuments D2 nicht auf einer erfinderischen Tätigkeit im Sinne des Artikels 56 EPÜ beruht.\n\n27. Die Hilfsanträge 2 und 3 sind deshalb nicht gewährbar.\n\n28. Der Einspruchsgrund unter Artikel 100(a) in Verbindung mit Artikel 56 EPÜ ist daher durchgreifend.",

The main request found allowable by the opposition division contains fourteen claims, with independent claim 1 reading as follows:\n\n\"A compound of the formula (I)\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nin the polymorph I which shows in the X-ray diffractometry peak maxima of the 2 Theta angel [sic] including 4.4, 10.7, 11.1, 11.4, 11.6, 12.2, 12.8, 13.2, 14.8, 16.5, 16.7, 17.7, 17.9, 18.8, 19.3, 19.6, 20.1, 20.5, 20.8, 21.5, 21.7, 22.3, 22.5, 22.9, 23.4, 23.7, 24.0, 24.5, 25.1, 25.4, 26.0, 26.4, 26.6, 27.0, 27.6, 28.2, 28.6, 28.8, 29.3, 29.6, 29.9, 30.8, 31.2, 31.6, 31.8, 32.1, 32.4, 32.7, 33.1, 33.8, 34.2, 34.6, 35.4, 35.7, 37.1.\"\n\nVI. In its statement setting out the grounds of appeal, the appellant contested the reasoning of the opposition division and submitted, inter alia, that the subject-matter of the claims of the main request considered by the opposition division did not involve an inventive step considering D1 as the closest prior art.\n\nVII. In its reply to the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, the patent proprietor (hereinafter \"respondent\") provided counter-arguments regarding, inter alia, inventive step. It submitted sets of claims of a main request, and auxiliary requests I and II. The set of claims of the main request is identical to that of the main request underlying the decision under appeal.\n\nVIII. By letter of 25 February 2019, opponent 2 informed the board that it would not be attending any oral proceedings which may be scheduled.\n\nIX. Oral proceedings before the board were scheduled in view of corresponding requests of the parties and held on 14 January 2020. Oral proceedings took place in the absence of duly summoned opponent 2 pursuant to Rule 115(2) EPC and Article 15(3) RPBA 2020.\n\nX. The appellant's arguments, where relevant to the present decision, may be summarised as follows:\n\n- D1 disclosed sorafenib tosylate without characterising the solid form thereof and without describing the synthesis thereof.\n\n- The distinguishing feature was the specific crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate, namely polymorph I.\n\n- The data provided by D32 and D41 only evidenced thermodynamic stability and not mechanical stability, since the tests therein concerned only the conversion or not of one polymorph of sorafenib tosylate to another solid form.\n\n- The objective technical problem was the provision a stable form of sorafenib tosylate.\n\n- The solution was obvious in view of the teaching of D25 (page 528, right column, second paragraph), D24 (page 948, right column, first paragraph) and D50 (page 225, left column, first paragraph). These documents taught routine methods of screening in the field of pharmaceutical drug development. The skilled person was aware that polymorphism was known in molecules useful in the pharmaceutical industry. It would have found forms I, II and III and considered the thermodynamically most stable form as the most likely successful candidate. Consequently, in the absence of any technical prejudice and in the absence of any unexpected property, the mere provision of the thermodynamically most stable crystalline form of a known pharmaceutically active compound did not involve an inventive step. This was in line with T 777/08.\n\nXI. The respondent's arguments, where relevant to the present decision, may be summarised as follows:\n\n- D1 was the closest prior art. It disclosed sorafenib toyslate in claim 22 without describing the physical form thereof and was silent about any crystalline form. The distinguishing feature was thus the specific crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate, namely polymorph I.\n\n- D32 and D41 showed that polymorph I of sorafenib tosylate was stable under mechanical stress conditions, while polymorphs II and III of sorafenib tosylate were unstable and partially transformed to an amorphous state under the same stress conditions.\n\n- The objective technical problem was the provision of a mechanically stable crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate suitable for the preparation of a pharmaceutical tablet.\n\n- The prior art did not give any hint as to whether a crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate could be obtained and, if so, how it could be prepared. The cited prior art did not even mention the possibility of modifying mechanical stress resistance by certain crystalline forms.\n\n- The provision of a thermodynamically stable crystalline form required two steps and was not a routine experiment, the process of crystallisation and the appearance of individual polymorphs depending from various factors, as mentioned in D25 (page 527, right column, first full paragraph).\n\n- It was in no way certain that the thermodynamically most stable form also was the mechanically stress resistant form. As shown in the experiments of D32, D40a and D41, sorafenib tosylate polymorphs II and III at least partially transformed to amorphous products under mechanical stress conditions. If mechanical stress stability was equal to thermodynamic stability, the skilled person would have expected that polymorphs II and III interconverted to the energetically more stable, i.e. thermodynamically stable, polymorph I under stress conditions.\n\n- The stability to mechanical stress of polymorph I was an unexpected effect in accordance with T 777/08 (headnote 1), T 517/14 (reasons 5.4) and and T 2114/13. The claimed subject-matter involved an inventive step.\n\nXII. The parties' final requests were the following:\n\n- The appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be revoked.\n\n- The respondent requested that the appeal be dismissed, or alternatively, that the patent be maintained in amended form on the basis of one of the sets of claims of auxiliary requests I or II submitted with the reply to the statement setting out the grounds of appeal.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\nMain request\n\nInventive step - Article 56 EPC\n\n1. The invention\n\nThe invention as defined in granted claim 1 concerns a specific crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate (polymorph I).\n\nPolymorph I according to the invention was found to be thermodynamically stable at room temperature and storage-stable and particularly suitable for preparations that are prepared via granulation or grinding (patent, paragraph [0007]).\n\n1.1 The closest prior art\n\nBoth parties considered the disclosure of D1 as the closest prior art.\n\nIn the same way as the patent, D1 aims at providing aryl ureas which are used for the treatment of disorders mediated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in which angiogenesis plays an important role, for example in tumor growth (abstract of D1). Claim 22 of D1 relates to a method of therapeutic treatment comprising administering N-(4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-N'-(4-(2-(N-methylcarbamoyl)-4-pyridyloxy)phenyl) urea tosylate. This compound is known as sorafenib tosylate.\n\nThe distinguishing feature in view of D1 is the crystalline form of sorafenib toyslate (\"polymorph I\") as defined in claim 1. D1 discloses sorafenib tosylate without characterising the form thereof.\n\n1.2 Formulation of the technical problem\n\nD32 shows in conjunction with D40b that polymorph I of sorafenib tosylate as claimed is thermodynamically stable under mechanical stress conditions. The mechanical stress test consists of grinding for about 30 seconds 100 mg of polymorph I in a mortar and comparing it with the untreated sample by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). D40b shows that the DSC thermograms of ground polymorph I (\"pestled\") and of the initial sample (\"untreated\") are the same.\n\nPolymorph II of sorafenib toyslate was also tested under the same conditions in D32. D40a shows a difference in the DSC thermograms of ground polymorph II and of the initial sample. The DSC thermogram of the ground polymorph II exhibits an additional peak at about 150°C, which is characteristic for a phase change from a crystalline form to an amorphous form, showing that this polymorph, contrary to polymorph I, at least partially transforms to an amorphous form when subjected to mechanical stress.\n\nPolymorph III of sorafenib tosylate was tested in D41. In test B, polymorph III was crushed in a mortar for 10 seconds. Thereafter, an X-Ray powder diffraction (XRPD) was measured (enclosure 3 of D41) and compared to the XRPD diagram of polymorph I (enclosure 4 of D41). In comparison to the XRPD diagram of polymorph I, the XRPD diagram of polymorph III shows a decrease of peak intensity and an increase of noise signals which demonstrate a change into the amorphous form of sorafenib tosylate.\n\nConsidering the above, D32, D40a, D40b and D41 show that polymorph I of sorafenib tosylate is more thermodynamically stable than polymorph II and polymorph III, which partially convert to the amorphous form when the polymorph is ground in a mortar. As submitted by the respondent with reference to D42 (bottom of page 2 to the top of page 3), during tablet pressing, an active ingredient is subjected to mechanical stress. By using a stable form of the active ingredient, the risk that it is converted to another form is reduced and helps to ensure the manufacture of a pharmaceutical product with consistent properties.\n\nIn view of these results, the objective technical problem is the provision of a stable crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate suitable for the preparation of a pharmaceutical tablet.\n\n1.3 Obviousness of the solution\n\nAs regards the preparation of a pharmaceutical product, D50 (paragraph 2.2 bridging pages 224 and 225) discloses the following:\n\n\"Die Modifikationen einer polymorphen Verbindung können sich in zahlreichen chemisch-physikalischen Eigenschaften unterscheiden...\n\nBesonders hervorzuheben sind die unterschiedlichen Löslichkeiten der Modifikationen, weil dadurch die Bioverfügbarkeit von Arzneimitteln beinflußt werden kann. Andere Eigenschaften wirken sich auf die Herstellung von Zubereitungen aus. Dazu zählen der Kristallhabitus (Fließfähigkeit), Härte und Dichte der Kristalle (Mahlung), Schmelzpunkt (Schmelzcharakteristik von Suppositorien), Löslichkeit (i.v.-Lösungen), thermodynamische Stabilität (Kristallwachstum und Entmischung von Suspensionsformulierungen). Aus diesem Grund ist es unerläßlich, die chemisch-physikalischen Eigenschaften der polymorphen Formen eines Wirkstoffs in der präklinischen Phase zu bestimmen. Zur Vermeidung von Unterschieden in der Bioverfügbarkeit und in der Verarbeitung zu Arzneimitteln ist dann die Modifikation mit günstigen Eigenschaften zu definieren. Dies ist in der Regel die bei Raumtemperatur thermodynamisch stabile Form des Wirkstoffs.\" (emphasis added by the board)\n\nD50 thus teaches that thermodynamic stability of a polymorphic form affects its suitability for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions. D50 continues that for avoiding changes during the manufacture of the pharmaceutical preparation, it is essential to define the polymorph with the most favourable properties, which is, as a general rule, the thermodynamically stable form. Those \"favourable properties\" include the avoidance of changes in the processing to a medicament, and thus implicitly include a step such as milling or grinding of the solid polymorph.\n\nThe above passage lastly discloses that, because inter alia the thermodynamic stability of a polymorphic form affects its suitability for preparing a pharmaceutical formulation, a screening of the different polymorphic forms is needed to determine their physico-chemical properties.\n\nThe need for screening and isolating the thermodynamically most stable form is confirmed by D25, which teaches that \"The thermodynamically stable polymorph needs to be identified ... These can be identified by simple techniques, for example by stirring or shaking excess solid with solid at different temperatures\" (first full paragraph of the right column on page 528).\n\nThe same follows from the review article D24 (first paragraph of the right column on page 948), disclosing that \"Selection of the most stable from [sic] would, of course, insure that it there [sic] would be no conversion into other forms\".\n\nFaced with the objective technical problem and starting from the sorafenib tosylate of D1, the skilled person would therefore have performed a screening of the different polymorphs of sorafenib tosylate which could exist in order to isolate and identify the thermodynamically most stable form thereof. By doing so, he would have arrived at polymorph I of sorafenib tosylate, which is the thermodynamically most stable form and which is, for this reason, expected not to convert to other forms under mechanical stress. It is to be noted in this context that none of the parties disputed that polymorph I of sorafenib tosylate is the thermodynamically most stable form and does not convert to other forms.\n\nThe subject-matter of claim 1 being directed to polymorph I of sorafenib tosylate, is thus obvious. Consequently the solution of claim 1 to the technical problem identified above (1.2, supra) does not involve an inventive step.\n\n1.4 This finding is in line with decisions T 777/08 (OJ EPO 2011, 633), T 517/14 and T 2114/13, cited by the respondent.\n\n1.4.1 According to decision T 777/08 (headnote I), the skilled person \"would be familiar with routine methods of screening. Consequently, in the absence of any technical prejudice and in the absence of any unexpected property, the mere provision of a crystalline form of a known pharmaceutically active compound cannot be regarded as involving an inventive step\".\n\nSince the property of polymorph I of sorafenib tosylate not to convert to other forms is expected by virtue of it being the thermodynamically most stable form, it does not represent an unexpected property as referred to in decision T 777/08. Consequently, the board's finding above is in line with decision T 777/08.\n\n1.4.2 The board notes that the facts of the present case differ from those that led to decision T 517/14 relied on by the respondent. In that decision (reasons, 5), the starting point was different, namely a monohydrate form of a certain salt of an active ingredient, the objective technical problem was different, namely the provision of a form of an active ingredient that was stable against degradation, and the situation with regard to obviousness was a different one in that in view of the available prior art, the solution the skilled person would have chosen in the case underlying T 517/14 was different from the claimed one. For this reason, decision T 517/14 is not relevant to the present case.\n\n1.4.3 In decision T 2114/13 (reasons, 5), inventive step was acknowledged on the basis that the closest prior art disclosed a mixture of two polymorphic forms of febuxostat and that the technical problem was the provision of a pharmaceutical composition of febuxostat with improved polymorphic stability, in particular during formulation.\n\nAlso this decision concerns a case that is different from the present one. The effect in case T 2114/13, i.e. polymorphic stability against \"solvent-mediated conversion\" of a slurry in acetone and water (second paragraph of point 5.4 of the reasons) is different from the effect in the present case (stability under mechanical stress) and the closest prior art in case T 2114/13 was a document disclosing a polymorphic mixture while the closest prior art in the present case relates to a compound whose form is not specified.\n\n1.5 The respondent also referred to D24 (pages 947, 948 and 952) and D25 (page 527, right column first full paragraph). It essentially argued that the process of crystallisation was poorly understood and was not a matter of routine experimentation, the process of crystallisation depending on various factors. The prior art did not teach a crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate. The skilled person had to take two steps to arrive at the invention starting from the amorphous form of sorafenib tosylate disclosed in D1, namely the provision of a crystalline form and the provision of the thermodynamically stable crystalline form.\n\nThe board is not convinced. Each of D24, D25 and D50 teaches to perform a screening of any pharmaceutical solids in order to isolate the thermodynamically most stable crystalline form, as set out above (1.3, supra). Therefore, the two-steps approach referred to by the respondent or the absence of any teaching in the prior art for a crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate did not represent a hindrance for the skilled person.\n\n1.6 The respondent further argued that D25 would have dissuaded the skilled person to use the thermodynamically most stable crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate for the preparation of a tablet in view of the last sentence of the second full paragraph in the left column on page 948 of the document, which reads:\n\n\"A metastable polymorph can be used in capsules or for tabletting, and the thermodynamically stable one for suspensions\".\n\nThe board notes that this general statement is conditional, due to the use of the term \"can be used\" in the sentence, so that the skilled person would not have mandatorily followed the teaching of this passage. Furthermore, the skilled person would have deduced from this sentence only that the metastable form of a polymorph is not stable enough to be used in suspensions. This does however not allow the reverse conclusion that the thermodynamically stable form cannot be used in capsules or for tabletting. For both reasons, the passage referred to by the respondent did not dissuade the skilled person from using the thermodynamically most stable crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate for the preparation of a tablet. Lastly, even if the passages were taken into consideration, the skilled person faced with the objective technical problem, would, as set out above, have carried out a screening in view of the general teaching of each of D24, D25 and D50, and would have isolated the thermodynamically most stable crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate which was expected not to convert to other forms.\n\n1.7 The respondent also argued that, if mechanical stress stability was equal to thermodynamic stability, the skilled person would have expected that polymorphs II and III interconverted to the energetically more stable, i.e. thermodynamically stable, polymorph I under stress conditions. The opposite had however been observed in D32, D40a, D40b and D41. Mechanical stress stability was thus not equivalent to thermodynamic stability. Document D42 (last four paragraphs on page 2) confirmed that mechanical stability and thermodynamic stability of a polymorph did not necessarily correlate and that the relationship between mechanical stability and thermodynamics was unpredictable. The prior art did not teach the possibility of modifying mechanical stress resistance.\n\nThe board does not agree. The present case is concerned with stability against a change of the polymorphic structure under mechanical stress. D42 however discusses \"mechanical stability\", which, as set out by the appellant, is rather the stability against mechanical disintegration. More specifically, D42 discusses which forces are \"decisive for keeping a crystal together\" (last line of page 1) and states that metastable forms have \"intermolecular interactions, which can be easier disrupted\" and continues that \"However, the assumption that they are mechanically less stable is wrong\" (fifth paragraph on page 2). Hence, D42 does not concern stability under mechanical stress. For this reason alone, the respondent's argument must fail. Furthermore, as established above (1.3, supra), the skilled person aiming at providing a stable crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate suitable for the preparation of a pharmaceutical tablet would have screened for the thermodynamically most stable crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate and would thus have arrived at polymorph I, irrespective of whether thermodynamic stability is identical to stability under mechanical stress and whether the prior art teaches the possibility of modifying mechanical stress resistance.\n\n1.8 Therefore, the respondent's reasoning does not hold good. Accordingly, the board's finding above that the subject-matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step can be confirmed.\n\n2. Auxiliary request I\n\n2.1 Claim 1 of auxiliary request I reads :\n\n\"A compound of the formula (I)\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nin the polymorph I which shows an X-ray diffraction pattern as shown in Figure 2\".\n\n2.2 Claim 1 of auxiliary request I relates to the same compound of formula (I) as claim 1 of the main request. Therefore the same reasoning for lack of inventive step of the subject-matter of the main request applies mutatis mutandis to claim 1 of auxiliary request I.\n\n2.3 Auxiliary request I is thus not allowable.\n\n3. Auxiliary request II\n\n3.1 Claim 1 of auxiliary request II relates to \"a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration\" comprising the compound of sorafenib tosylate\" in the polymorph I [sic!] which shows in the X-ray diffractometry peak maxima of the 2 Theta angle including 4.4, 10.7, 11.1, 11.4, 11.6, 12.2, 12.8, 13.2, 14.8, 16.5, 16.7, 17.7, 17.9, 18.8, 19.3, 19.6, 20.1, 20.5, 20.8, 21.5, 21.7, 22.3, 22.5, 22.9, 23.4, 23.7, 24.0, 24.5, 25.1, 25.4, 26.0, 26.4, 26.6, 27.0, 27.6, 28.2, 28.6, 28.8, 29.3, 29.6, 29.9, 30.8, 31.2, 31.6, 31.8, 32.1, 32.4, 32.7, 33.1, 33.8, 34.2, 34.6, 35.4, 35.7, 37.1, which is a tablet\" (emphasis added by the board).\n\n3.2 The board notes that claim 1 of auxiliary request II only differs from claim 1 of the main request in that it concerns a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration in the form of a tablet. These differences have no impact on the choice of closest prior art, the distinguishing feature and the objective technical problem. More specifically, D1 is still the closest prior art, the distinguishing feature is still the specific crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate (\"polymorph I\") and the objective technical problem remains the provision of a stable crystalline form of sorafenib tosylate suitable for the preparation of a pharmaceutical tablet. Also the reasoning above with regard to the obviousness of the subject-matter of the main request still applies to this request. More specifically, for the same reasons as given for the main request, the skilled person would, in view of D24, D25 and D50, have applied a screening for isolating the thermodynamically most stable form and would thereby have arrived at the subject-matter of claim 1 in an obvious manner.\n\n3.3 For this reason, the same reasoning for lack of inventive step of the subject-matter of the main request applies mutatis mutandis to claim 1 of auxiliary request II.\n\n3.4 Auxiliary request II is thus not allowable.\n\n4. The board concludes that none of the claim requests of the appellant is allowable under Article 52(1) in combination with Article 56 EPC.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The Appellant (Proprietor of the patent) lodged an appeal against the decision of the Opposition Division revoking European patent No. 1 890 998, whose claim 1 reads as follows:\n\n\"1. A process for preparing mixtures comprising diphenylmethane diisocyanates and polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanates comprising the step of reacting the corresponding mixtures of diphenybnethanediamines [sic] and polyphenylpolymethylenepolyamines with phosgene in the presence of at least one solvent in stages whereby in a first stage the corresponding carbamoyl chlorides and amine hydrochlorides are formed and whereby in a subsequent stage residual carbamoyl chlorides are dissociated into the corresponding polyisocyanates and hydrogen chloride and amine hydrochlorides are phosgenated to form ultimately the corresponding polyisocyanates characterised in that a controlled amount of amine hydrochloride solids remain unreacted at the point where residual excess phosgene is removed from the reaction mixture, wherein the residual content of amine hydrochloride solids at the point where residual excess phosgene is removed from the reaction mixture is between 10 and 5000 ppm, and wherein said solid carbamoyl chlorides and/or solid ureas are not present at the point where residual excess phosgene is removed from the reaction mixture.\"\n\nII. Notice of opposition had been filed by the Respondent (Opponent) requesting revocation of the patent-in-suit in its entirety on the grounds of lack of novelty and inventive step (Article 100(a) EPC), insufficient disclosure of the invention (Article 100(b) EPC) and extension of the subject-matter of the patent-in-suit beyond the content of the application as filed (Article 100(c) EPC).\n\nIII. According to the Opposition Division, the grounds of opposition under Article 100(c) EPC did not prejudice to the maintenance of the patent as granted.\n\nAs regards to the ground of opposition pursuant to Article 100(b) EPC, the Opposition Division considered that claim 1 of the patent as granted covered three alternatives, two of which avoiding the formation of solid ureas completely. However, the skilled person was not able, using his common general knowledge alone, to provide a process which avoids the formation of solid ureas completely. The information in the patent that such a process required \"careful design\" of the mixing device, without further details, and without a single specific detailed example of a suitable mixing device, indicated that the design of such a mixing device was not a routine task which the skilled person would be able to perform without the use of inventive skill.\n\nIt was possible using analytical techniques to determine the amine hydrochloride content of a mixture of solid constituents, but not to make an instant determination of the amine hydrochloride solids, so that the skilled person did not known whether the amount of amine hydrochloride solids fell within the claimed range in order to remove the residual excess phosgene, as required by claim 1. Consequently, the skilled person could not perform the claimed process.\n\nThe Opposition Division came therefore to the conclusion that the patent must be revoked for insufficiency of disclosure of the invention.\n\nIV. According to the Appellant, the invention related to a process for making PMDI (polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanates) having improved colour. To achieve this goal, a controlled amount of solid amine hydrochlorides must be present at the point where the excess phosgene was removed from reaction mixture. Both ureas solids and carbamoyl chloride solids should not be present at that point. The process could not be operated in the presence of solid ureas and/or solid carbamoyl chlorides, as this would quickly clog the filters and/or the pipes. Solid ureas could be avoided by using appropriate mixing devices. This was known from the prior art. It was also known that carbamoyl solids could be eliminated by heating the reaction mixture. The amount of solids must be determined at the point of time at which residual excess phosgene was removed. This could be done by taking samples at that point, but samples could also be taken at later or earlier points. Since the process was continuous, the samples could be analysed within a sensible time-frame. The analysis of the solids could be done by isolating the solids from the sample. Via infra-red, it could be measured if compounds having urea groups were present. Via X-ray fluorescence (XRF), it could be measured the chlorine content to determine how much amine hydrochloride was present. In the event that amine hydrochloride solids were not in the required amount or urea and/or carbamoyl solids were present, the process conditions would be modified in a manner known to the skilled person until the correct solids content was present. The control of the amount of the solids in the reaction mixture could be done for instance as described in [0039] and [0050] of the patent by controlling the turbidity of the reaction mixture. By using appropriate reference solutions, the turbidity value could easily be converted to ppm values. Thus, the process of claim 1 was sufficiently disclosed to be operated by a skilled person.\n\nV. According to the Respondent, claim 1 encompassed three embodiments depending on the composition of the solids present at the point where residual excess phosgene was removed from the reaction mixture, i.e. the solids contained (1) amine hydrochloride solids exclusively; (2) amine hydrochloride solids and carbamoyl solids, free of solid ureas; and (3) amine hydrochloride solids and solid ureas, free of carbamoyl solids. The skilled person was unable to carry out the claimed process where 0 ppm solid ureas was present (situations (1) and (2)), as well as where (huge) amount of solid ureas was present (situation (3)). This was even recognized by the Appellant. Furthermore, there was no indication in the patent in suit how to measure the residual content of the amine hydrochloride solids if mixed with other solids at the point where residual excess phosgene was removed from the reaction mixture, let alone if this measure was to be done instantly. Accordingly, the skilled person would not be able to determine the concentration of amine hydrochloride solids at that time without undue burden. Furthermore, based on Figure 1, paragraphs 37-42 and 50, of the patent in suit, the skilled person would understand that the amount or content of amine hydrochloride salt was to be determined with an in-line turbidity meter. However, carrying out a turbidity measurement to determine a relative amount in ppm would always be dependent on various parameters including the medium used for the measurements. There was no disclosure in the patent in suit how the relative amount in ppm of solid amine hydrochloride could be obtained from a turbidity measure.\n\nTherefore, for these reasons, the requirements of Article 83 EPC were not met.\n\nVI. The Appellant (Patent Proprietor) requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the case be remitted to the Opposition Division for further examination on the basis of the patent as granted or, alternatively, on the basis of any one of the first to eighth auxiliary requests, all auxiliary requests as filed with the statement setting out the grounds of appeal dated 21 March 2017.\n\nThe Respondent (Opponent) requested that the appeal be dismissed.\n\nVII. At the end of the oral proceedings held on 1 June 2021, the decision of the Board was announced.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeal is admissible.\n\nMain request: patent as granted\n\nSufficiency of disclosure of the invention Article 100(b) EPC\n\n2. The patent relates to a method for preparing di- and polyisocyanates (PMDI). The invention aims at reducing the colour of PMDI and thus at obtaining them with a higher HunterLab colour (L). To achieve this object the method of claim 1 requires that between 10 and 5000 ppm amine hydrochloride solids remain in the reaction mixture at the point where residual excess phosgene is removed -see paragraphs [0021] and [0038] of the patent in suit.\n\nClaim 1 also requires that solid carbamoyl chlorides and/or solid ureas are not present at the point where residual excess phosgene is removed from the reaction mixture.\n\n3. According to the Respondent, this requirement expanses to three embodiments, i.e. the solids present at the point where residual excess phosgene is removed from the reaction mixture can be\n\n1) Amine hydrochloride solids exclusively;\n\n2) Amine hydrochloride solids and carbamoyl solids, free of solid ureas;\n\n3) Amine hydrochloride solids and solid ureas, free of carbamoyl solids.\n\nTherefore, in order to fulfil the requirement of Article 83 EPC, the skilled person must be able to carry out the claimed process where 0 ppm solid ureas are present (situations 1 and 2), as well as where a large amount of solid ureas is present (situation 3).\n\nAccording to the case law, the skilled person should try, with synthetical propensity, i.e. building up rather than tearing down, to arrive at an interpretation of the claim which is technically sensible and takes into account the background of the invention and the whole disclosure of the patent. The patent must be construed by a mind willing to understand, not a mind desirous of misunderstanding. That means that technically illogical interpretations should be excluded.\n\nIn the present case, claim 1 requires that no solid carbamoyl chlorides and/or solid ureas should be present at said stage of the process. Having regard to the background of the invention, the formation of both of these two solids should generally be avoided in processes for preparing PMDI, although small quantities of solid ureas or carbamoyl chlorides may be tolerated. The Appellant also indicated that it was not possible to carry out the process in the presence of large quantities of solid ureas for the obvious reason that this would quickly block the pipes.\n\nThe Board first notes that the requirement of claim 1 of the patent as granted that no solid carbamoyl chlorides and/or solid ureas should be present does not characterise the invention, but places the invention in the context of prior art processes that seek to minimise or eliminate the formation of solids. Therefore, to interpret that claim 1 requires the process to be carried out with large quantities of solid ureas is contrary to a reasonable interpretation of claim 1 of the patent as granted and would violate the spirit of the invention.\n\nSimilarly, when carrying the claimed process, the person skilled in the art would not be guided by the objective of obtaining 0 ppm of solid ureas formed, as this is impossible to achieve in this process.\n\nIn the Board's understanding, the requirement that solid carbamoyl chlorides and/or solid ureas are not present at the point where residual excess phosgene is removed from the reaction mixture is satisfied by using the means known from the prior art in this respect. The presence of solid ureas can be avoided by using known mixing devices that minimise urea by-products, thereby avoiding the formation of insoluble polyureas. It was not disputed that carbamoyl solids are avoided by heating the reaction mixture, as indicated in the patent on page 4, lines 52-53.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent's arguments that the requirements of Article 83 EPC are not met because the claimed process cannot be carried out with large amounts or with 0 ppm solid ureas is rejected.\n\n4. According to the Respondent, the skilled person was not able to carry out the claimed process without undue burden since there was nothing in the patent in suit indicating how to measure the residual content of amine hydrochloride solids mixed with other solids. Determination of the residual content of amine hydrochloride solids needed to be done instantly, at the point where residual phosgene was removed.\n\nHowever, claim 1 does not require an instant measure of the amount of amine hydrochloride. In order to carry out the process with an appropriate content of amine hydrochloride solids, the skilled person can take an aliquot of the reaction mixture at the time where the excess of phosgene is removed, filter it, weight the solids present in the mixture, and then determine the amount of the amine hydrochloride in the filtered solids. If the amount of solid amine salt present in the reaction mixture is too high or too low, the process parameters can be adjusted, for example by decreasing or increasing the residence time of the reaction mixture, until a value of the residual amine salt within the claimed range is obtained.\n\n5. According to the Respondent, the amine hydrochloride content could not be determined by the skilled person without undue burden. The development of an analytical method for the determination of solid amine hydrochlorides in a complex precipitate, which contained other constituents, was extremely complex and would require several weeks of development by an expert in the field of solid analysis. This amounted to an undue burden.\n\nFirst, the Board notes that it is not necessary to analyse the content of the amine hydrochloride present in the solid precipitate in the solid state. Without evidence to the contrary, the determination of the content by weight of amine hydrochloride salts in a complex mixture containing urea derivatives or carbamoyl derivatives is deemed to be achievable by numerous analytical methods, or even by separation of the amine salt fraction. The statement that the analysis of the amine hydrochloride content of the precipitate would last several weeks is unfounded. Accordingly, the Respondent's argument should be rejected, especially as the Respondent has made no (unsuccessful) attempt to analyse such precipitate.\n\n6. According to the Respondent, the relative amount in ppm of solid amine hydrochlorides could not be deduced from a turbidity value.\n\nThe Board notes that claim 1 does not require the relative amount in ppm to be deduced from the turbidity value. The Respondent's objection is thus not convincing for this reason alone.\n\nThe objection could apply at the most to the example of the patent in suit, in which the part per million level of solid amine hydrochloride is determined by a calibrated turbidity meter. The process disclosed in the example of the patent in suit is carried out at a temperature of 80 to 95 °C, such that no carbamoyl solid is present. Furthermore, the first stage of the process is carried out in a static mixing nozzle device, which avoids the formation of solids ureas.\n\nWith the help of suitable reference compositions containing known amounts of solid amines formed by the reaction, it would have been possible to correlate the turbidity value with the amount of solid amine suspended in the solution with a given degree of accuracy. The value in ppm of solid amine can be adjusted if necessary by taking into account other solid components present in the reaction medium, such as ureas solids.\n\nThe Board therefore does not see any deficiency in the description of the invention in the fact that the example in the patent in suit indicates that the quantity of solid amine is given in ppm on the basis of a turbidity value.\n\nThis objection of the Respondent must also be rejected.\n\n7. The Board comes therefore to the conclusion that the invention as defined in claim 1 of the patent as granted can be performed by a person skilled in the art without undue burden, using common general knowledge and having regard to further information given in the patent in suit, such that the opposition ground pursuant to Article 100(b) EPC fails.\n\nOther issues\n\n8. There were requests to not admit documents to the appeal proceedings. However, as the documents are not needed by the Board to arrive at its conclusion that the invention is sufficiently disclosed, their admission into the proceedings need not be decided by the Board. If necessary, their admission may be decided by the Opposition Division following the remittal.\n\nRemittal\n\n9. As the opposition division has not yet ruled on the ground of opposition pursuant Article 100(a) EPC, the Board considers it appropriate to remit the case to the Opposition Division for further prosecution. This was also requested by both parties.",

The appeal of the applicant (\"the appellant\") lies from the decision of the examining division refusing European patent application No. 16 179 565.3 (\"the application\") entitled \"Methods and compositions for treating complement-associated disorders\".\n\nII. The examining division held that claims 1 to 9 of the main request did not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC and that the subject-matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 did not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC.\n\nIII. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant submitted sets of claims of a main request and an auxiliary request 1, with the main request identical to auxiliary request l and auxiliary request l identical to the main request on which the decision under appeal was based, and, inter alia, argued in favour of inventive step.\n\nIV. The board summoned the appellant to oral proceedings, as it had requested, and subsequently issued a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA in which it, inter alia, provided its preliminary opinion with respect to inventive step of the subject-matter of claim 1 of both requests.\n\nV. In response to the board's communication, the appellant submitted by letter dated 13 April 2021 sets of claims of further auxiliary requests 1 and 3 and four documents (numbered hereafter D11 to D14). The auxiliary request submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal was renumbered as auxiliary request 2.\n\nClaim 1 of the main request and auxiliary request 1 thus reads:\n\n\"1. An inhibitor of human complement component C5 for use in treating myasthenia gravis (MG) in a human, wherein the inhibitor is an anti-C5 antibody.\"\n\nClaim 1 of each of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 thus reads:\n\n\"1. Eculizumab for use in treating myasthenia gravis (MG) in a human.\"\n\nVI. At the request of the appellant, oral proceedings were held by videoconference. At the end of these proceedings, the chair announced the board's decision.\n\nVII.

The appellant's arguments, where relevant to the decision, are summarised as follows.\n\nInventive step (Article 56 EPC)\n\nMain request and auxiliary request 1 - claim 1\n\nDocument D4, disclosing the set-up of a clinical trial study to determine the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), represented the closest prior art.\n\nThe proposition of this clinical trial did not provide the skilled person with a reasonable expectation of success that MG could be treated with eculizumab, because targeting the complement system did not inevitably result in treatment of a complement-associated disorder, as was evident from various unsuccessful attempts to target complement factors in different diseases.\n\nFor example, the complement inhibitor sCR-1 (TP-10), which had been considered a suitable drug candidate for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute myocardial infarction, had failed when tested in clinical trials (document D11, page 159, second paragraph). Document D12 confirmed that sCR-1 had indeed been defunded.\n\nFurther, as was evident from document D13, the anti-C5 single chain variable fragment pexelizumab did not show any clinical improvement in a phase 3 clinical trial in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (page 49, right-hand column, last paragraph), despite the fact that the complement system had been known to be activated in this disease (page 43, left-hand column, last paragraph), inhibition of C5 had been considered \"an attractive target\" (page 43, right-hand column, last sentence), and pexelizumab had resulted in reduced infarct size in experimental models (page 44, left-hand column, first paragraph). These observations were confirmed in document D14.\n\nThat the clinical trial protocol disclosed in document D4 did not lead to a reasonable expectation of the skilled person that MG could be treated successfully with an anti-C5 antibody was further underlined by the fact that MG was particularly difficult to treat in humans, as evident from document D7 which disclosed that no therapy for generalised MG had been approved in more than 60 years.\n\nThe facts underlying the present case were different from those underlying decisions T 239/16 (point 6.5 of the Reasons) and T 2506/12 (points 3.10 and 3.15 of the Reasons) cited by the examining division. In those cases, contrary to the case in hand, the treatment of the respective diseases with either a similar group of agents or separate agents of the claimed combination was known to the skilled person.\n\nDocument D2 did not provide an expectation of success that MG could be treated with an anti-C5 antibody either, because it disclosed the use of a passive immunisation model for MG (passive EAMG), i.e. a model which, according to document D5, was not a suitable model for human MG, as it represented only the effector stage of the disease (page 16, right-hand column, second paragraph).\n\nConsequently, the claimed invention was not obvious to the skilled person and therefore involved an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).\n\nAuxiliary requests 2 and 3\n\nThe appellant did not submit any tailor-made arguments for this claimed invention in the context of inventive step.\n\nIX. The appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the set of claims of the main request submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal or, alternatively, on the basis of the set of claims of one of auxiliary requests 1 to 3 submitted with the letter of 13 April 2021.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeal complies with Articles 106 to 108 and Rule 99 EPC and is admissible.\n\nInventive step (Article 56 EPC)\n\nMain request and auxiliary request 1 - claim 1\n\nClosest prior art and objective technical problem\n\n2. Claimed is an inhibitor of human complement component C5 for use in treating MG in a human, wherein the inhibitor is an anti-C5 antibody (see section V.). One example of such compounds is eculizumab (see application page 8, line 11).\n\n3. The examining division considered that the protocol of a safety and efficacy clinical trial of eculizumab in patients with refractory generalised MG disclosed in document D4 represented the closest prior art, and formulated the objective technical problem as \"the provision of evidence-based medical application of an anti-C5 antibody in human [sic]\".\n\n4. According to established jurisprudence of the boards of appeal, the closest prior art should be a teaching directed to the same purpose or effect as the claimed invention (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 9th edition, 2019, I.D.3.2.). The board therefore holds that actual therapies for treatment of MG in humans, such as therapies with immunosuppressants including prednisone, methotrexate, cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide, also disclosed in document D4 (page 1), represent the closest prior art, rather than the clinical trial protocol which is also disclosed there.\n\n5. The claimed subject-matter differs from the known MG therapies in humans in that the therapeutic is an inhibitor of human complement component C5, wherein the inhibitor is an anti-C5 antibody (\"C5 antibody\").\n\n6. The application does not attribute a particular technical effect to the claimed therapeutic in the claimed use, which goes beyond the technical effect of the known MG therapies. The objective technical problem can thus be formulated as the provision of an alternative treatment of MG in humans. This has not been contested by the appellant.\n\nObviousness\n\n7. Document D4 discloses a protocol of a safety and efficacy clinical trial of eculizumab in patients with refractory generalised MG. The results of this clinical trial are not disclosed. Thus, document D4 proposes the antibody eculizumab (an inhibitory C5 antibody) as an alternative therapeutic for refractory generalised MG in humans.\n\n8. Clinical trials are conventionally based on earlier preclinical studies, and the potential therapeutics tested in clinical trials are duly selected based on experimental data suggesting their success (see e.g. decision T 239/16, point 6.5 of the Reasons).\n\n9. Thus, the board considers that the announcement of a detailed safety and efficacy clinical trial protocol for a particular therapeutic and disease provided the skilled person with a reasonable expectation of the success of this particular therapeutic, unless there was evidence to the contrary in the state of the art. In the case in hand, the board holds that no such evidence to the contrary has been brought forward by the appellant.\n\n10. The appellant has submitted that the disclosure of the clinical trial protocol of document D4 constituted, at most, an invitation for the skilled person to try the treatment of MG with eculizumab. Indeed, MG was particularly difficult to treat in humans, as was evident from document D7 which disclosed that no therapy for generalised MG had been approved in more than 60 years.\n\n11. The board however fails to see how the mere fact that no MG therapy has been approved for a long time would have diminished the expectation of success for the specific clinical trial disclosed in document D4.\n\n12. The appellant further submitted that many clinical trials directed at treating a complement-associated disorder with a complement inhibitor had failed, as evident from the disclosures in documents D11 and D13.\n\n13. The studies disclosed in documents D11 and D13 concern complement inhibitors other than eculizumab (sCR-1 and pexelizumab) to treat diseases different from MG (acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute myocardial infarction). Furthermore, the complement cascade is a complex system involving multiple proteins having been implicated in a large number of different diseases. In view of this complexity, the board is satisfied that the failure of other complement inhibitors to treat diseases unrelated to MG did not necessarily call into question the skilled person's expectation that MG could be treated successfully with eculizumab. In fact, in the board's view, only evidence relating to the same compound and disease would be suitable for this purpose.\n\n14. Consequently, the board concludes that the disclosure of documents D11 and D13 did not call into question the expectation of success the skilled person had from document D4 announcing a phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of MG with eculizumab.\n\n15. The appellant further submitted that the teaching in document D2 did \"not support\" the skilled person's expectation of successful treatment of MG in humans with eculizumab, since the experimental animal model used in document D2 was not a suitable model for human MG, as it represented only the effector stage of the disease (see document D5, page 16, right-hand column, first full paragraph).\n\n16. The board considers that the disclosure of the clinical trial in document D4 as such provided the skilled person setting out to provide an alternative therapeutic for the treatment of MG with a reasonable expectation that the treatment of MG in humans with eculizumab would be successful (see point 9.).\n\n17. Furthermore, the teaching of document D2 does not call into question this expectation. In fact, it discloses successful treatment of experimental MG induced in mice with an anti-C5 antibody, which in 2008, i.e. after publication of document D5's review on MG animal models, was considered \"so encouraging that human clinical trials using eculizumab are expected to begin within the next year\" (document Dl, second last paragraph on page 2). The skilled person would thus have considered, even after the publication of document D5, that the animal model used in document D2 was a suitable animal model for human MG and that the successful treatment of experimental MG induced in mice with an anti-C5 antibody would be encouraging for treating MG in humans.\n\n18. Thus, the board concludes that no evidence is on file calling into question that MG could be treated with eculizumab in humans, as proposed in the phase 2 clinical trial study disclosed in document D4.\n\n19. In view of the above considerations, the board holds that the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request was obvious to the skilled person. Consequently, the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request and claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 does not involve an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.\n\nAuxiliary requests 2 and 3\n\n20. The subject-matter of claim 1 of each of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 differs from the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request in that the anti-C5 antibody is now explicitly defined as being eculizumab (see section V.).\n\n21. The appellant did not submit any tailor-made arguments for this claimed invention in the context of inventive step.\n\n22. The board considers that the teaching of document D4 provided a reasonable expectation of success for the treatment of MG with the specific anti-C5 antibody eculizumab (see point 16.). The same considerations as for claim 1 of the main request and auxiliary request 1 hence apply to claim 1 of each of auxiliary requests 2 and 3.\n\n23. Consequently, the board holds that the subject-matter of claim 1 of each of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 does not involve an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC, either.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. An appeal was lodged by the patent proprietor (appellant) against the decision of the opposition division to revoke European patent No. 2 278 002 (\"the patent\") entitled \"Pancreatin with reduced viral content\".\n\nII. The patent was opposed on the grounds of Article 100(a) EPC, in relation to novelty (Article 54 EPC) and inventive step (Article 56 EPC), and of Article 100(b) EPC, in relation to disclosure of the invention.\n\nIII. In its decision, the opposition division held, inter alia, that the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request (as amended) lacked novelty over the disclosure of documents D2/D9, D6, D18, D20, D26 and D28a (Article 54 EPC).\n\nWith regard to auxiliary requests 1 to 23, the opposition division held that the subject-matter of claim 1 thereof lacked novelty for the same reasons as the main request.\n\nMoreover, auxiliary requests 4 to 7 and 16 to 19 did not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.\n\nFurthermore, auxiliary requests 12 to 23 did not meet the requirements of Articles 84 EPC or 123(3) EPC.\n\nIV. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant filed sets of claims of a main request and of auxiliary requests 1 to 7 (which are identical to the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 3 and 8 to 11, respectively, that were considered in the decision under appeal).\n\nV. The opponent (respondent) replied to the statement of grounds of appeal.\n\nVI. The board summoned the parties to oral proceedings by video-conference, as requested by both parties, and informed them of its preliminary opinion in a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA.\n\nVII. Oral proceedings were held by video-conference.\n\nAt the end of the oral proceedings, the Chair announced the board's decision.\n\nVIII. Claim 1 of the main request reads:\n\n\"1. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmacologically effective quantity of a pancreatin and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients,\n\nwherein the pancreatin is decreased in viral contaminants, and is obtainable by a process comprising the steps of\n\n(a) pre-heating a dispersed form of pancreatin containing one or more solvents to a temperature of from 85 °C to 100 °C, and\n\n(b) continuing heating of the dispersed form of pancreatin at a temperature of from 85 °C to 100 °C for a period of from 18 hours to 30 hours, and obtaining a total solvents content in the dispersed form of pancreatin of equal to or less than 3.5% by weight at any point during process step (b),\n\nwherein the dispersed form of pancreatin is selected from powders, pellets, micropellets, microspheres, granules and granulates,\n\nwherein the titer level of any viral contaminant present in the dispersed pancreatin after heating is at least 1000 times less, than the titer level of said viral contaminant present in the dispersed pancreatin prior to heating, and\n\nwherein the pancreatin lipase activity after heating is at least 50% of the lipase activity prior to heating.\"\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 1 reads as follows (difference over the main request is underlined):\n\n\"1. ... viral contaminant present in the dispersed pancreatin after heating is at least 10000 times less,... \"\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 2 reads as follows (differences over the main request are underlined):\n\n\"1. ...\n\n(a) ... from 85 °C to 95 °C ...\n\n(b) ... from 85 °C to 95 °C ...\"\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 3 reads as follows (differences over the main request are underlined):\n\n\"1. ...\n\n(a) ... from 85 °C to 95 °C ...\n\n(b) ... from 85 °C to 95 °C ...\n\n... viral contaminant present in the dispersed pancreatin after heating is at least 10000 times less,...\"\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 4 reads as follows (differences over the main request are underlined):\n\n\"1.

The following documents are cited in the present decision:\n\nD2 |JP 49-36886 A |\n\nD9 |English translation of document D2 |\n\nD24|European Medicines Agency (EMEA): CHMP/BWP report to the CMDh on pancreatin-containing products |\n\nX. The appellant's arguments are summarised as follows.\n\nMain request - claim 1\n\nClaim construction and novelty (Article 54 EPC)\n\nThe claim recited process steps that reduced viral activity, i.e. a sterilisation procedure. Although the process features as such were not to be considered when assessing novelty, the properties conferred by these process features did have to be taken into account when assessing novelty. As explained and exemplified in the patent, the process steps sterilised the product, thereby reducing the concentration of viral contaminants. A product that had been through a sterilisation process could be readily distinguished from a product that had not, regardless of the initial viral content.\n\nThe skilled person would appreciate that a \"titer level ... at least 1000 times less\" corresponded to a 3-log reduction, which was a standard term used to describe products that had been exposed to a sterilisation procedure that reduced viral load. In this regard, biomanufacturing processes often included steps that aimed to reduce virus load. These steps were evaluated in order to determine their viral clearance capacity. Viral clearance was defined as the difference between the total virus amount in the input sample and in the output sample, i.e. the product-containing fraction after purification. The viral reduction capability was then referred to as the log reduction value (LRV) of a process step.\n\nIn the absence of any explicit disclosure in the state of the art regarding the level of viral contaminants within the pancreatin fraction after purification, it could not be simply assumed that a pancreatin fraction disclosed in the prior art fell within the scope of the claims. This was evident from document D24, a report generated by the EMEA assessing the viral risk of pancreatin products. This document stated that: \"[f]rom the above analysis, the assessment of the risk with HEV leads to the conclusion that its presence in the drug substance batches cannot be excluded\" and \"[s]cientific studies using infectivity assays have proven that non-enveloped viruses (PPV) are indeed present in batches of pancreatin\".\n\nThus, in order for a disclosure to prejudice novelty, it had to be demonstrated that the output pancreatin sample had been exposed to a sterilisation process that (i) decreased the concentration of viral contaminants by at least 3-log titers so that the the output sample had low levels of virus and thus could be safely administered to a patient; and that (ii) maintained the activity of the pancreatin such that it was suitable for achieving the therapeutic effect.\n\nIn the absence of any evidence to show that the pancreatin provided according to documents D1, D2/D9, D6, D18, D20, D26 and D28 had the low levels of viral content demanded by the claim, the disclosure within these documents did not anticipate the claimed pancreatin.\n\nAuxiliary requests 1 to 7\n\nNovelty (Article 54 EPC)\n\nThe same arguments as for the main request applied.\n\nXI. The respondent's arguments are summarised as follows.\n\nMain request - claim 1\n\nClaim construction and novelty (Article 54 EPC)\n\nThe claim contained only three direct product features, namely \"pharmaceutical composition\", \"comprising a pharmacologically effective quantity of a pancreatin\" and \"one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients\".\n\nThe feature \"the dispersed form of pancreatin is selected from powders, pellets, micropellets, microspheres, granules and granulates\" did not have a limiting effect on the product because it only related to the starting material. The form of the pancreatin could, however, change during the process, either through the heating process and/or the solvent or through other process steps which were not mentioned in the claim, but were not excluded (\"comprising the steps of ...\").\n\nIn the absence of a precise definition of the starting material in terms of lipase activity and viral load, the respective functional definitions in the claim resulted in relative values and thus did not have a limiting effect on the product. Document D24, which was cited by the appellant, only showed that different batches of pancreatin could contain certain viruses (e.g. HEV) or not.\n\nThe required \"total solvent content\" did not have a limiting effect either, as it could be reached at \"any point during process step (b)\" and could also increase again towards the end of the process.\n\nIn conclusion, claim 1 was directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising pancreatin and at least one excipient.\n\nConsequently, the subject-matter of claim 1 lacked novelty over the disclosure of documents D1, D2/D9, D6, D18, D20, D26 and D28.\n\nAuxiliary requests 1 to 7\n\nNovelty (Article 54 EPC)\n\nThe same arguments as for the main request applied.\n\nXII. The appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be maintained based on the main request filed by letter dated 19 July 2019 or, alternatively, on one of auxiliary requests 1 to 7 filed by letter dated 19 July 2019 as auxiliary requests 1 to 3 and 8 to 11, respectively.\n\nThe respondent requested that the appeal be dismissed.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeal complies with Articles 106 to 108 and Rule 99 EPC and is admissible.\n\nMain request - claim 1\n\nClaim construction and novelty (Article 54 EPC)\n\n2. The pancreatin comprised in the claimed pharmaceutical composition is, inter alia, defined by a process (\"obtainable by\") comprising the two steps (a) and (b) (see section VIII. above).\n\n3. As rightly pointed out by the appellant - and in accordance with established case law of the Boards of Appeal - process features defining a product are not taken into account when determining the characteristics of this product, i.e. a product is not considered distinguished from a product of the state of the art only because it is obtained by a different process. However, properties conferred by the process to the product are taken into account (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 9th edition, 2019, I.C.5.2.7 and II.A.7.1 and 7.2).\n\n4. According to the appellant, the process steps describe a sterilisation process by heating. The direct result of the process is recited in the claim, i.e. the titer level of any viral contaminant after heating is at least 1000 times less than the level prior to heating. According to the appellant, this reduction is referred to as a \"3-log\" reduction. In view of the appellant's submission, the board considers the property of the process imparted on the pancreatin to be an at least 3-log reduction of any viral contaminant (see, however, points 6. to 10. below).\n\n5. Pancreatin as a constituent of the claimed pharmaceutical composition is further defined by two functional features: the \"titer level of any viral contaminant present in the dispersed pancreatin after heating is at least 1000 times less, than the titer level of said viral contaminant present in the dispersed pancreatin prior to heating\" and \"the pancreatin lipase activity after heating is at least 50% of the lipase activity prior to heating\".\n\n6. It is common general knowledge that pancreatin is derived from animals and that, depending on the source, its levels of lipase activity and viral contaminants vary (see e.g. document D24). Thus, the product-by-process feature (see points 3. and 4. above) and the corresponding functional feature (see point 5. above) do not define the titer level of the viral contaminants in the output pancreatin product after heating in absolute terms, but relative to the values in the input product. The same applies to the residual lipase activity.\n\n7. Hence, since the starting material for the process defined in the claim can be pancreatin from any source, the titer level of viral contaminants prior to and after heating and the lipase activity prior to and after heating may take any value (see point 6. above).\n\n8. The appellant argues that for a disclosure to prejudice the novelty of the subject-matter of claim 1, absent any disclosure in the prior art of the features at issue, it had to be demonstrated that an output pancreatin product had been exposed to a sterilisation process that decreased the viral load by at least 3-log titers and that the lipase activity was maintained such that the product was suitable for therapeutic purposes.\n\n9. Document D2/D9 discloses in Example 1 (page 2) the sterilisation of pancreatin under vacuum for 5 hours at 125 to 130 °C. This heat sterilisation process falls within the process definition in claim 1, thus imparting to the pancreatin the same properties as to the claimed one (see point 4. above).\n\n10. The animal source of pancreatin is not disclosed in document D2/D9, but the claim is not limited to pancreatin from a particular source in any case (see point 7. above).\n\n11. In view of the claim construction in points 2. to 7. above, document D2/D9 discloses a pancreatin product which is the same as the one defined in claim 1, without the need for the actual demonstration of the properties of the disclosed product.\n\n12. The subject-matter of claim 1 lacks novelty over the disclosure of document D2/D9.\n\nAuxiliary requests 1 to 7 - claim 1\n\n13. In the absence of further arguments from the appellant with regard to the novelty of the subject-matter of claim 1 of these requests, the same reasons as for claim 1 of the main request apply.\n\n14. The subject-matter of claim 1 of auxiliary requests 1 to 7 lacks novelty.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. Two oppositions were filed against European patent No. 2 734 549, entitled \"Monoclonal antibody against dog interleukin-31\", under Article 100(a) (in conjunction with Article 56 EPC), (b) and (c) EPC. The opposition division decided to reject the oppositions.\n\nII. Opponent 2 (appellant) filed an appeal against this decision. Opponent 1 is party as of right to the appeal proceedings but made no substantive submissions in the appeal proceedings.\n\nIII. With its statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant argued that the claims as granted and all of auxiliary requests 1 to 23 as filed during the opposition proceedings, contained subject-matter which extended beyond the content of the application as filed (Articles 100(c) and 123(2) EPC), did not disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art (Articles 100(b) and 83 EPC), and would be obvious to a person skilled in the art (Articles 100(a) and 56 EPC).\n\nIV. The patent proprietor (respondent) replied and filed new auxiliary requests 2B, 3B, 4B, 6B, 7B, 9B, 11B, 14B, 15B, 16B, 18B, 19B, 21B, 23B, and 24 to 35.\n\nV. The board issued summons for oral proceedings and a communication under Article 15(1) RPBA in which the board provided its preliminary opinion on some of the issues relevant to the appeal.\n\nVI. In reply the respondent filed new auxiliary requests 7Ba, 9Ba, 19Ba, 21Ba, 31a and 33a. With a further letter the respondent filed a corrected auxiliary request 31a.\n\nVII. Opponent 1 announced that it would not attend oral proceedings.\n\nVIII. Oral proceedings before the board were held by video conference as requested by the parties present at the oral proceedings.\n\nDuring these oral proceedings, the respondent disapproved of the text of the patent as granted and of all requests on file. At the end of the oral proceedings, the Chairman announced the decision of the board.",

According to Article 113(2) EPC, the European Patent Office shall decide upon the European patent only in the text submitted to it, or agreed, by the proprietor of the patent.\n\n3. Such an agreement does not exist if the patent proprietor - as in the present case - has expressly stated that it disapproves of the text of the patent as granted and of all pending requests.\n\n4. There is therefore no text on the basis of which the board can maintain the patent. In these circumstances, the proceedings are to be terminated by a decision ordering revocation of the patent, without substantive examination as to patentability (see decision T 73/84, OJ EPO, 1985, 241 and Case Law of the Boards of Appeal 9th edition, 2019, IV.D.2, paragraphs 2 and 3).",

At the oral proceedings before the board, the patent proprietor stated that they no longer approved the text of the patent as granted or the text of the patent as maintained by the opposition division. Furthermore, they stated that they withdrew all the requests pending in the appeal proceedings and stated that they did not intend to submit any further amended text in the proceedings.\n\nVI.

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The appeal by the patent proprietor (appellant) concerns the decision of the opposition division to revoke European patent No. 1 737 486, entitled \"Immunising against meningococcal serogroup Y using proteins\".\n\nII. The patent had been opposed as a whole under Article 100(a) EPC on the grounds of lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), and under Article 100(b) and (c) EPC.\n\nIII. The decision under appeal dealt with sets of claims of a main request (claims as granted) and eight auxiliary requests. The opposition division held that the patent as granted was sufficiently disclosed (Article 83 EPC) and did not relate to subject-matter extending beyond the content of the application as filed (Article 123(2) EPC). The claimed subject-matter was also novel (Article 54 EPC). However, the opposition division was of the opinion that the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request and of auxiliary requests 1 to 5 did not involve an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).\n\nIV. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant maintained all the claim requests considered in the decision under appeal and filed a further set of claims as auxiliary request 9.\n\nV. The opponent (respondent) filed a reply to the statement of grounds of appeal.\n\nVI. By letter dated 1 December 2016 the appellant withdrew all the claim requests on file. At the same time, they filed a new main and a new auxiliary request.\n\nVII. By letter dated 28 April 2017 the respondent withdrew the opposition.\n\nVIII. With a communication according to Rule 100(2) EPC, the board informed the appellant that, in its preliminary view, the arguments submitted by the former respondent with respect to the assessment of inventive step, and the opposition division's arguments in this respect in the decision under appeal, addressed subject-matter which did not require the presence of all five proteins (i) to (v) in combination. These arguments, therefore, did not apply to the subject-matter set out in claim 1 of the auxiliary request filed on 1 December 2016. The claims of this auxiliary request also overcame the respondent's clarity objection resulting from the wording \"wherein the polypeptides include\", which was raised with regard to claim 1 of auxiliary request 5 as filed with the statement of grounds of appeal. This wording was still present in claim 1 of the main request of 1 December 2016.\n\nIX. In reply, the appellant made the auxiliary request their sole request.\n\nX. Claims 1 and 12 of the main (sole) request read:\n\n\"1. A composition comprising immunogenic Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B polypeptides for use in a method of immunising a subject against infection by serogroup Y of Neisseria meningitidis, wherein the composition includes all five of:\n\n(i) a NadA protein, which (a) has 80% or more identity to SEQ ID NO: 2 or (b) comprises a fragment of at least 20 consecutive amino acids from SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein the fragment comprises an epitope; and\n\n(ii) a '741' protein, which (a) has 80% or more identity to SEQ ID NO: 3 or (b) comprises a fragment of at least 20 consecutive amino acids from SEQ ID NO: 3, wherein the fragment comprises an epitope; and\n\n(iii) a '287' protein, which (a) has 80% or more identity to SEQ ID NO: 6 or (b) comprises a fragment of at least 20 consecutive amino acids from SEQ ID NO: 6, wherein the fragment comprises an epitope; and\n\n(iv) a '936' protein, which (a) has 80% or more identity to SEQ ID NO: 4 or (b) comprises a fragment of at least 20 consecutive amino acids from SEQ ID NO: 4, wherein the fragment comprises an epitope; and\n\n(v) a '953' protein, which (a) has 80% or more identity to SEQ ID NO: 5 or (b) comprises a fragment of at least 20 consecutive amino acids from SEQ ID NO: 5, wherein the fragment comprises an epitope.\n\n12. The use of immunogenic Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B polypeptides in the manufacture of a medicament for immunising a subject against infection by serogroup Y of Neisseria meningitidis, wherein the medicament includes all five of:\n\n(i) a NadA protein, which (a) has 80% or more identity to SEQ ID NO: 2 or (b) comprises a fragment of at least 20 consecutive amino acids from SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein the fragment comprises an epitope; and\n\n(ii) a '741' protein, which (a) has 80% or more identity to SEQ ID NO: 3 or (b) comprises a fragment of at least 20 consecutive amino acids from SEQ ID NO: 3, wherein the fragment comprises an epitope; and\n\n(iii) a '287' protein, which (a) has 80% or more identity to SEQ ID NO: 6 or (b) comprises a fragment of at least 20 consecutive amino acids from SEQ ID NO: 6, wherein the fragment comprises an epitope; and\n\n(iv) a '936' protein, which (a) has 80% or more identity to SEQ ID NO: 4 or (b) comprises a fragment of at least 20 consecutive amino acids from SEQ ID NO: 4, wherein the fragment comprises an epitope; and\n\n(v) a '953' protein, which (a) has 80% or more identity to SEQ ID NO: 5 or (b) comprises a fragment of at least 20 consecutive amino acids from SEQ ID NO: 5, wherein the fragment comprises an epitope.\"\n\nXI.

The appellant's arguments submitted in writing, in so far as relevant to this decision, may be summarised as follows:\n\nAdmission of the main request into the appeal proceedings - Article 13 RPBA 2007\n\nThis request was filed as a reaction to the respondent's clarity objection, which had not been raised prior to the appeal proceedings.\n\nInventive step - Article 56 EPC\n\nThe decision under appeal did not contain any reasoning with respect to auxiliary request 5 before the opposition division, which required a combination of all five proteins 'NadA', '741', '287', '936' and '953'. This composition was used in the examples in the patent. No documents had been cited which would have led the skilled person in an obvious way to this combination of proteins.\n\nXIII. The appellant requested in writing that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be maintained on the basis of the claims of the main request filed by letter dated 24 July 2019.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeal is admissible as it complies with the requirements specified in Articles 106 to 108 EPC and the further provisions referred to in Rule 101(1) EPC.\n\n2. Since they withdrew their opposition, the respondent ceased to be a party to the appeal proceedings as regards substantive issues. No other issues for which the respondent would have remained a party to the proceedings arose in this case.\n\n3. As the impugned decision resulted in the revocation of the patent, the withdrawal of the opposition had no procedural consequences for the appeal proceedings. The board must still examine the opposition division's decision in order to ascertain if it is to be set aside and whether the patent, account being taken of the amendments made by the appellant in the form of the main request, and the invention to which it relates, meet the requirements of the EPC.\n\nMain request\n\n4. Claim 1 concerns a composition for use in immunising a subject against infection by serogroup Y Neisseria meningitidis, the composition including five polypeptides as defined in the claim (for the claim wording see point X. above).\n\nThis claim differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request 5 before the opposition division in that the wording \"wherein the composition includes all five of\" replaces the wording \"wherein the polypeptides include\". Claim 12 is amended accordingly.\n\nAdmission into the appeal proceedings - Article 13 RPBA 2007\n\n5. In the case in hand, the parties were sent a communication under Rule 100(2) EPC before 1 January 2020. Therefore, Article 13(2) RPBA 2020 does not apply, and Article 13 RPBA 2007 continues to apply instead (Article 25(3) RPBA 2020).\n\n6. The main request was filed after the statement of grounds of appeal, so, in view of Article 13(1) RPBA 2007, it is at the board's discretion whether to admit it into the appeal proceedings.\n\nAccording to this provision, the board's discretion is to be exercised in view of inter alia the complexity of the new subject-matter submitted, the current state of the proceedings and the need for procedural economy. Furthermore, the criteria developed by the boards of appeal in the context of Article 13(1) RPBA 2007 include the suitability of the amendment to resolve the issues raised by the other party or the board in appeal proceedings without giving rise to new objections.\n\n7. As concerns the state of the proceedings, the appellant argued that the filing was a reaction to objections in the reply to the appeal, in which questions were indeed raised about the interpretation of claim 1 of auxiliary request 5 as filed with the statement of grounds of appeal. The board notes that the decision under appeal did not discuss this possible understanding of the claim at issue. As a consequence, it appears that the issue could not have been addressed by the appellant earlier in the proceedings.\n\n8. As discussed below (see point 13.), the request addresses this issue by making it clear that the composition includes all five polypeptides (i) to (v). This wording of the claim resolves the interpretation issue without prima facie creating new problems.\n\n9. Thus, the board admits the request into the appeal proceedings.\n\nInventive step - Article 56 EPC\n\n10. With respect to auxiliary request 5 before it, the opposition division held that the subject-matter of claim 1 did not involve an inventive step. The appellant contested this finding. As noted above, however, claim 1 of the request before the board differs from that auxiliary request in that it makes it clear that the composition includes all five polypeptides (i) to (v).\n\n11. In the following, the board will assess how far the opposition division's reasoning with regard to previous auxiliary request 5 applies to the claims before the board, and how convincingly that reasoning is addressed by the appellant's arguments.\n\n12. In claim 1 of the main request considered by the opposition division, the composition only had to include one, two or three polypeptides from the three defined in the claim. The claim thus defined embodiments where the composition included a single polypeptide. The opposition division held that this embodiment of the claimed subject-matter lacked an inventive step. The opposition division came to this conclusion because it considered that a composition having the '741' protein for immunising against infection by MenY was obvious having regard to document D1 in view of any of documents D2, D3 and D8.\n\nWith respect to auxiliary request 5, the opposition division reasoned that the conclusions as to the main request applied because claim 1 \"[...] of AR1-5 due to their respective wording are all referring to composition [sic] for use in a method of immunising a subject against infection by serogroup Y of Neisseria meningitidis, wherein the composition can comprise a '741' protein [...]\".\n\n13. However, claim 1 before the board no longer includes the possibility of a composition having only one of the five proteins, instead requiring the presence of all five of them.\n\n14. As pointed out by the appellant, since this claim requires the presence of five proteins, the reasoning in the decision under appeal does not apply.\n\n15. The same goes for the former respondent's submissions on lack of inventive step since these were also made with regard to a claim worded such that the composition did not necessarily include each of the five polypeptides listed. On the contrary, it could include multiple '741' peptides but not any of the other polypeptides listed.\n\n16. The board notes that the experimental results in the patent refer to bactericidal activity of a five-polypeptide combination on serogroup Y strains. The experiments did not use single-polypeptide compositions. In fact, some of the former respondent's arguments in the context of sufficiency of disclosure and inventive step (with respect to the main request previously on file) relied precisely on this point, i.e. that the claim encompassed compositions comprising a single polypeptide whereas the experiments were carried out with a five-polypeptide combination.\n\n17. There are no submissions on file that lead the board to conclude that the effect in terms of the bactericidal activity of the composition is due solely to the polypeptide '741'. Furthermore, the board has not been presented with arguments that would render the other components of the composition obvious.\n\n18. Thus, there are no arguments on file which question the presence of an inventive step for the subject-matter as defined in the claims of the main request before the board.\n\n19. Moreover, the board has come to the conclusion that none of the further arguments of the former respondent stand in the way of the allowability of the present request. The board does not see any reason to raise objections of its own motion.",
         "Order, For these reasons it is decided that:, 1. The decision under appeal is set aside., 2. The case is remitted to the opposition division with the order to maintain the patent on the basis of the claims according to the main request and a description to be adapted thereto.",

The opponent (appellant) duly filed an appeal against the decision of the opposition division that the patent in amended form according to the main request met the requirements of the EPC. The patent proprietor is respondent to this appeal.\n\nII. With its statement of grounds of appeal, the opponent requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be revoked.\n\nIII. The board issued a summons to oral proceedings, as requested by both parties, and in a subsequent communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, provided its preliminary appreciation of the appeal case.\n\nIV. By letter of 13 December 2022, the respondent informed the board that,it no longer approved the text of the patent as granted, nor the text of the patent as amended during the opposition proceedings. Moreover it would not pursue any of the pending requests on file, including the auxiliary claim requests, and would not not propose any amended text. It further withdrew the request for oral proceedings.\n\nV. The board subsequently cancelled the oral proceedings.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeal is admissible.\n\n2. Pursuant to the principle of party disposition established by Article 113(2) EPC, the EPO shall examine, and decide upon, the European patent only in the text submitted to it, or agreed, by the proprietor of the patent.\n\n3. Such an agreement cannot be deemed to exist where - as in the present case - the patent proprietor expressly states that it no longer approves the text of the patent as granted and withdraws all pending claim requests.\n\n4. There is therefore no text of the patent on the basis of which the board can consider the appeal. In these circumstances, the proceedings are to be terminated by a decision ordering revocation of the patent without assessing issues relating to patentability (see decision T 73/84, OJ EPO 1985, 241, and Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 10th edition 2022, III.B.3.3).\n\n5.

The opponent (in the following \"appellant\") filed an appeal against the decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition filed against the European patent No. 2 808 340, entitled \"Recombinant FSH including alpha 2,3- and alpha 2,6-sialylation\".\n\nII. With the statement of grounds of appeal the appellant requested, inter alia, that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be revoked.\n\nIII. With the reply to the statement of grounds of appeal the patent proprietor (in the following \"respondent\") requested, inter alia, that the appeal be dismissed and the patent be maintained as granted or, alternatively, that the patent be maintained on the basis of the auxiliary request filed in opposition proceedings.\n\nIV. Both the appellant and the respondent made further submissions.\n\nV. The board issued a summons to oral proceedings to be held on 10 December 2021 and a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA.\n\nVI. Both parties replied, the respondent inter alia by filing claim sets of auxiliary requests 2 and 3.\n\nVII. By letter dated 1 December 2021 the respondent informed the board as follows: \"The Patent Proprietor no longer approves of the text in which the above-mentioned patent was granted and will not submit an amended text.\"\n\nVIII. The parties were informed by a communication dated 3 December 2021 that the oral proceedings were cancelled.\n\nIX. In a further communication of the same date, the board referred to the respondent's statement in their letter dated 1 December 2021 (see point VII. above) and informed the parties of the board's understanding of their statement.\n\nX. By letter dated 17 December 2021 the respondent informed the board as follows: \"The Patent Proprietor herewith confirms the Board's understanding that he no longer approves of the text in which the above-mentioned patent was granted, nor of any of the auxiliary requests, and will not submit an amended text.\" (highlighting in the original).",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeal complies with Articles 106 to 108 and Rule 99 EPC and is admissible.\n\n2.

The patent proprietor-respondent stated that they no longer approve of the text in which the patent was granted, nor of any of the auxiliary requests, and will not submit an amended text (see section X. above).\n\n4. There is therefore no text on the basis of which the board can decide.\n\n5. According to the established case law of the boards of appeal under these circumstances the patent is to be revoked without further examination of the case as to patentability (see decision T 73/84, OJ EPO 1985, 241, followed by numerous decisions, see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 9th Edition 2019, IV.D.2).

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The patent proprietor and opponents 1, 4, 5 and 6 lodged an appeal against the interlocutory decision of the opposition division, posted on 15 November 2018 and finding that European patent No. 2 242 512 as amended according to auxiliary request 4 met the requirements of the EPC. While the patent proprietor, opponents 1 to 5 and opponent 7 had received the decision within ten days following its dispatch, opponent 6 had acknowledged receipt with a date of 3 January 2019.\n\nII. With their statement setting out the grounds of appeal, the patent proprietor requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be maintained on the basis of the set of claims of the main request or, alternatively, on the basis of the set of claims of one of the auxiliary requests 1 to 5, all filed with their statement setting out the grounds of appeal.\n\nIII. The appealing opponents (see section I) all requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be revoked in its entirety.\n\nIV. In a communication of the Registry dated 21 February 2019, the board noted that the notice of appeal on behalf of opponent 6 had been received on 14 January 2019 and raised concern as to whether the appeal fee was duly paid.\n\nV. On 25 February 2019, opponent 6 paid the appeal fee.\n\nVI. In their reply to the appeals of the opponents, the patent proprietor requested that the appeal of opponent 6 be held inadmissible, for failure to pay the appeal fee in due time.\n\nVII. With a letter dated 6 January 2021, the patent proprietor informed the board as follows:\n\n\"The Proprietor hereby withdraws its approval under Rule 71 EPC of the text in which European Patent No. 2242512 was granted. The Proprietor will not be filing a replacement text. For the avoidance of doubt, the Proprietor also withdraws all requests pending in the appeal proceedings.\n\nIn the absence of a text agreed by the Proprietor, the opposition proceedings relating to this patent are terminated following Article 113(2) EPC, and the patent must be revoked....\".",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeals of all parties comply with the requirements of Articles 106 to 108 EPC and the further provisions referred to in Rule 101 EPC and are admissible.\n\n2. In relation to opponent 6's appeal, the only issue at stake was whether the appeal fee was duly paid. Whether or not the appeal fee had already been validly paid on 14 January 2019 is irrelevant in the circumstances of the present case. At least for the reason that opponent 6's appeal fee was duly paid on 25 February 2019, which is within two months of notification of the decision under appeal to opponent 6, i.e. calculated from 3 January 2019 in accordance with Rule 126(2), Rule 131(1) and (4) EPC, the board concludes that also opponent 6's appeal is admissible.\n\n3. Pursuant to Article 113(2) EPC the European Patent Office shall examine, and decide upon the European patent application or the European patent only in the text submitted to it, or agreed, by the applicant or the proprietor of the patent.\n\n4. Since the text of the patent is at the disposition of the patent proprietor, their patent cannot be maintained against their will. In the present case the patent proprietor withdrew its approval of the text of the patent as granted. By withdrawing their auxiliary requests, they also unequivocally withdrew their approval of the text of the patent as amended according to any of these requests. There is therefore no longer any text of the patent in the proceedings which the board can consider for compliance with the requirements of the EPC.\n\n5. It is established case law that in the present circumstances the patent must be revoked without further substantive examination as to patentability (see decision T 73/84, OJ EPO 1985, 241 and Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 9th edition 2019, section IV.D.2).\n\n6. The board has no reason to deviate from this consistent approach of the boards of appeal, with the consequence that the patent is to be revoked. Revocation of the patent complies with the requests of all appealing parties.\n\n7. The present decision can therefore be taken without holding oral proceedings.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. European patent No. 2 075 000 (patent in suit) derives from European patent application No. 09 075 100.9 (application as filed), which is a divisional of European patent application No. 03 738 280.1 (parent application, published as international application  No. WO 03/105856 A1).\n\nII. The patent in suit was granted with a set of 18 claims. Independent claim 1 reads as follows:\n\n\"1. A pharmaceutical formulation which comprises azelastine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, and ciclesonide.\"\n\nIII. The patent was opposed under Article 100(a), (b) and (c) EPC on the grounds that the claimed subject-matter did not involve an inventive step, was not disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art and extended beyond the content of both the application and the parent application as filed.\n\nIV. The patent proprietor requested as its main request that the opposition be rejected, and also filed four auxiliary requests. The claims of auxiliary request I were identical to claims 1 to 16 as granted.\n\nV. The documents cited in the course of the opposition proceedings included the following:\n\nD2:   Submission dated 20 August 2010, filed by the patent proprietor during the examination proceedings regarding the patent in suit\n\nD6:   J Clin Pharmacol 39, 1062-1069 (1999)\n\nD10:  EP 0 780 127 A1\n\nD11:  Declaration by G. Malhotra including \"Exhibit A: Experimental report\" (15 December 2016)\n\nVI. The decision under appeal is the opposition division's interlocutory decision, announced on 23 October 2017 and posted on 23 November 2017, finding that the patent as amended in the form of auxiliary request I met the requirements of the EPC.\n\nVII. According to the decision under appeal:\n\n(a) The claims of the patent as granted (main request) did not contain added subject-matter and met the requirements of Articles 76(1) and 123(2) EPC.\n\n(b) They also met the requirement of sufficiency of disclosure (Article 100(b) EPC).\n\n(c) Document D10 represented the closest prior art as it related to nasal sprays containing an antihistamine, which could be azelastine, and a glucocorticosteroid. Starting from the technical teaching of D10, the subject-matter of claims 1 to 16 as granted involved an inventive step, but the subject-matter of claims 17 and 18 as granted did not (Articles 52(1) and 56 EPC).\n\n(d) This objection was overcome by auxiliary request I, in which claims 17 and 18 had been deleted.\n\nDocument D10 did not mention ciclesonide but did disclose combining azelastine with budesonide. Taking into account the experimental data provided by the patent proprietor in documents D2 and D11, it was credible that formulations comprising azelastine and ciclesonide (as defined in claim 1) were more stable than corresponding formulations comprising azelastine and budesonide. The objective technical problem was thus to provide an effective and more stable medicament for the treatment of conditions affecting the eyes and the nose. In view of the structural similarity of ciclesonide and budesonide, the person skilled in the art would not have predicted the improvement in stability. For this reason, the formulations according to claims 1 to 16 of auxiliary request I would not have been an obvious solution.\n\nVIII. The opponent (appellant) appealed against this decision, requesting that the patent be revoked. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, the appellant submitted documents D14 to D24. D14 is the opposition appeal decision revoking the patent deriving from the parent application.\n\nD14: T 0609/12\n\nIX. With its reply to the appellant's statement setting out the grounds of appeal, the patent proprietor (respondent) submitted a main request and seven auxiliary requests and filed document D25.\n\nThe claims of the main request are identical to those of former auxiliary request I held allowable in the decision under appeal (see points II. and IV. above).\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request I reads as follows:\n\n\"1. A pharmaceutical formulation which comprises azelastine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, and ciclesonide, wherein the pharmaceutical formulation is in a form suitable for nasal or ocular administration.\"\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request II reads as follows:\n\n\"1. A pharmaceutical formulation which comprises an admixture of azelastine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ciclesonide and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, wherein the pharmaceutical formulation is in a form suitable for nasal or ocular administration.\"\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request III reads as follows:\n\n\"1. A pharmaceutical formulation which is an aqueous suspension or solution comprising azelastine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, and ciclesonide, wherein the pharmaceutical formulation is in a form suitable for nasal or ocular administration.\"\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request IV reads as follows:\n\n\"1. A pharmaceutical formulation which comprises an admixture of azelastine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ciclesonide, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient comprises microcrystalline cellulose and carboxyl methyl cellulose sodium, and the pharmaceutical formulation is in a form suitable for nasal or ocular administration.\"\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request V reads as follows:\n\n\"1. A pharmaceutical formulation which is an aqueous solution or suspension, comprising azelastine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ciclesonide, microcrystalline cellulose and carboxyl methyl cellulose sodium, and wherein the pharmaceutical formulation is in a form suitable for nasal or ocular administration.\"\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request VI reads as follows:\n\n\"1. A pharmaceutical formulation which comprises an admixture of azelastine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ciclesonide and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient comprises microcrystalline cellulose and carboxyl methyl cellulose sodium in an amount of 0.65 to 3.0% by weight of the formulation, and the pharmaceutical formulation is in a form suitable for nasal or ocular administration.\"\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request VII reads as follows:\n\n\"1. A pharmaceutical formulation which is an aqueous suspension or solution, comprising an admixture of azelastine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ciclesonide and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient comprises microcrystalline cellulose and carboxyl methyl cellulose sodium in an amount of 0.65 to 3.0% by weight of the formulation, and the pharmaceutical formulation is in a form suitable for nasal or ocular administration.\"\n\nX. The appellant's arguments regarding inventive step, as far as relevant to the present decision, may be summarised as follows.\n\nD10 was a suitable starting point for the problem-and-solution approach.\n\nThe alleged technical effect of improved stability should be disregarded when defining the technical problem to be solved, for, inter alia, the following reasons.\n\nThe alleged benefit of better stability could not be conclusively derived from the respondent's post-filed test reports D2 and/or D11 (if these were to be taken into account), nor was it relevant for formulations in which azelastine and the steroid were physically separate.\n\nMoreover, documents D2 and D11 related only to a comparison of the combinations azelastine/ciclesonide and azelastine/budesonide, yet the prior art in example III of D10 also disclosed the preferred combination azelastine/triamcinolone acetonide. No evidence had been provided that this combination was not stable. Even if, as submitted by the respondent, the specific formulation in example III was not showing suitable properties, this drug combination could nevertheless have been tested in a different, more suitable formulation (e.g. such as described in D11).\n\nAccordingly, the objective technical problem had to be formulated as providing an alternative pharmaceutical composition for treating allergic conditions.\n\nSince, at the effective date of the patent in suit, ciclesonide was known (from, inter alia, document D6) as a new potent steroid drug in the field of anti-allergy treatments, the person skilled in the art would have contemplated using it as a first and obvious choice.\n\nThe appellant did not present any comments concerning the respondent's auxiliary requests.\n\nXI. The respondent's arguments regarding inventive step, as far as relevant to the present decision, may be summarised as follows.\n\nIn view of the passage immediately following formulation example III in D10, which included the statement:\n\n\"Additionally, substantially similar results are also obtained using, in whole or in part, equivalent amounts of other glucocorticoid agents such as fluticasone, mometasone, budesonide, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and mixtures thereof.\"\n\nany combination of azelastine with triamcinolone, fluticasone, mometasone and budesonide could be considered the closest starting point for the assessment of inventive step. However, because of the structural similarity of budesonide and ciclesonide, the combination of azelastine and budesonide was the most appropriate starting point in document D10.\n\nThe stated aim of the invention was to provide a stable and effective combination of azelastine and a steroid (paragraph bridging pages 1 and 2 and paragraph 4 on page 2 of the parent application [sic]). Thus, post-filed evidence relating to stability could be taken into account.\n\nAs demonstrated by the comparative stability data provided in documents D2 and D11, a pharmaceutical formulation comprising azelastine and ciclesonide was more stable than one comprising azelastine and budesonide derived from the prior art, which showed significant budesonide degradation.\n\nFormulation example III of D10, in which triamcinolone acetonide was combined with azelastine, had been found by the respondent to be inoperable. In response to the appellant's objection that no evidence had been provided in support of this assertion, reference was made to decision T 0609/12 (D14), the appeal decision issued in respect of the parent application, which included results for example III of D10.\n\nFurthermore, the formulation according to example II of D10 would be expected to be hyperosmotic and unsuitable for nasal or ocular application, due to its excipient composition.\n\nAll this suggested that document D10 was unreliable.\n\nStarting from the technical teaching of document D10, the objective technical problem was to provide a more stable and effective pharmaceutical formulation comprising an antihistamine and a glucocorticosteroid.\n\nDocument D10 mentioned several choices for the antihistamine, and it did not mention ciclesonide at all as a possible choice for the steroid. Therefore, nothing in D10 would have prompted the person skilled in the art to pick azelastine or its salts as the antihistamine and ciclesonide as the steroid on the expectation of achieving an improvement over the known combinations of antihistamines and corticosteroids.\n\nDocument D6 related to ciclesonide monotherapy and did not contain any pointers suggesting combination therapy.\n\nSince budesonide and ciclesonide were structurally similar, the increased stability was an unexpected advantage rendering the claimed formulation inventive. In this context, the patent proprietor did not need to provide any explanation for the observed difference in stability.\n\nEven if the comparative studies D2 and D11 were not to be taken into account, the claimed formulation would still be inventive since the prior art did not teach that the combination of azelastine and ciclesonide was stable and effective, and, in this context, more effective than monotherapy with either drug.\n\nThe technical problem should in that case be re-formulated as \"provision of a combination of an antihistamine and a glucocorticosteroid having a rapid onset of action and quick relief\".\n\nXII. The board issued a summons inviting the parties to attend oral proceedings.\n\nIn a communication under Article 15(1) RPBA the board advised the parties of its preliminary opinion, inter alia setting out some of the inventive-step issues which might require consideration at the oral proceedings. These included the appellant's argument that a comparison with the combination of azelastine and triamcinolone acetonide should have been made (see point 3.4.2 of the communication).\n\nThe communication also pointed out that none of auxiliary requests I to VIII had been presented during the proceedings before the opposition division, and that the respondent had not explained the purpose of these new requests, i.e. how they might address any argument raised by the appellant (see point 4.1 of the communication).\n\nXIII. By letter dated 26 March 2021, the appellant's representative withdrew the appellant's request for oral proceedings and stated that it would not be attending the oral proceedings scheduled for 10 June 2021.\n\nXIV. By letter dated 1 June 2021, the respondent indicated it would not be attending the oral proceedings.\n\nXV. Neither party replied in substance to the board's preliminary opinion.\n\nXVI. The board cancelled the oral proceedings and advised the parties that the appeal proceedings would be continued in writing.\n\nXVII. This decision is based on the following requests by the parties:\n\n(a) The appellant (opponent) requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent in suit be revoked.\n\nWithin the purview of these requests, the appellant also requested that documents D15 to D24 be admitted into the proceedings.\n\n(b) The respondent (patent proprietor) requested that the appeal be dismissed and that the patent be maintained in the amended form upheld by the opposition division (main request);\n\nor, in the alternative, that the patent be maintained according to one of auxiliary requests I to VII, all filed with the reply to the statement setting out the grounds of appeal.\n\nWithin the purview of these requests, the respondent also requested that documents D15 to D24 not be admitted, but that document D25 be admitted into the proceedings.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. Admissibility of the appeal\n\nThe appeal complies with Articles 106 to 108 EPC and Rule 99 EPC; it is admissible.\n\n2. Main request - inventive step (Articles 100(a), 52(1) and 56 EPC)\n\nPatent in suit\n\n2.1 The patent in suit seeks to provide formulations combining the effects of antihistamine treatments and corticosteroid treatments, preferably for nasal or ocular administration (see paragraphs [0001] and [0005] of the patent). Azelastine is to be used as the antihistamine (see claim 1).\n\n2.2 The patent in suit also contains the following statement (see paragraph [0006]):\n\n\"We have now found that, very surprisingly, azelastine (4-[(4-Chlorophenyl)methyl]-2-(hexa-hydro-1-methyl-1H-azepin-4-yl)-1(2H)pthalazinone), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically functional derivative thereof, preferably in salt form and even more preferably in the form of the hydrochloride salt, can advantageously be combined with a steroid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically functional derivative thereof, to provide a stable, very effective combination product or formulation preferably for nasal or ocular treatment. The combination can provide, in a single administration or dosing regime, the antihistaminic properties of azelastine and the anti-inflammatory (and/or other) properties of the steroid, without any significant interference between the two, or adverse reaction in situ.\"\n\nCombinations of azelastine with various steroids are mentioned in the description (see paragraphs [0008], [0094], examples 2-14).\n\n2.3 Claim 1 of the main request defines a pharmaceutical formulation comprising azelastine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt (presumably of azelastine) as the antihistamine, and ciclesonide as the steroid.\n\nStarting point in the prior art\n\n2.4 It is common ground that document D10, which is concerned with treating allergic disorders, in particular allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, is a suitable starting point for the assessment of inventive step.\n\n2.5 D10 relates to nasal spray compositions containing a glucocorticoid (corticosteroid) and a leukotriene-inhibiting antihistamine selected from cetirizine, loratadine, azelastine, pharmaceutically acceptable salts or racemates thereof or mixtures thereof. The steroid may be beclomethasone, flunisolide, triamcinolone, fluticasone, mometasone, budesonide or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or mixtures thereof (see D10: claim 1 and page 2, lines 5 to 6 and 25 to 27). Ciclesonide is not mentioned.\n\n2.6 Example III of D10 discloses a specific formulation comprising azelastine hydrochloride and triamcinolone acetonide, various excipients and water, to be used for topical nasal application to provide relief from allergy or allergy-like symptoms. Immediately following this disclosure it is also mentioned that (D10: page 6, lines 26 to 46):\n\n\"Additionally, substantially similar results are also obtained using, in whole or in part, equivalent amounts of other glucocorticoid agents such as fluticasone, mometasone, budesonide, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and mixtures thereof.\"\n\n2.7 Hence, combinations of azelastine with triamcinolone acetonide, fluticasone, mometasone or budesonide are disclosed in D10 at the same level of preference.\n\nObjective technical problem and solution\n\n2.8 The formulation according to claim 1 of the main request differs from these prior-art formulations in that it uses ciclesonide as the steroid combination partner of azelastine.\n\n2.9 According to the respondent, this has the advantage that the claimed combination of azelastine and ciclesonide is more stable than the combination of azelastine and budesonide, as supported by the comparative studies reported in D2 and D11.\n\n2.10 While the application as filed states that combining azelastine with steroids will provide stable and effective formulations, it neither suggests that the combination of azelastine with ciclesonide is more stable than other combinations nor contains any experimental data on stability. The appellant therefore questioned whether it was appropriate to take post-filed data into account.\n\n2.11 Irrespective of this issue, however, and as also pointed out by the appellant, the combination of azelastine with budesonide is not the only comparative combination to be considered. The combination of azelastine with triamcinolone acetonide is an equally legitimate starting point in the prior art (see point 2.7 above).\n\n2.12 A perceived closer structural similarity of budesonide with ciclesonide is not a convincing reason for ruling out the combination of azelastine with triamcinolone acetonide (or, indeed, with fluticasone or mometasone) as another feasible starting point, nor does it remove the requirement to demonstrate the alleged technical effect in relation to that alternative starting point. If it were shown (as argued by the respondent) that the combination of azelastine with budesonide is less stable than the combination of azelastine with ciclesonide, it would not necessarily follow that the combination of azelastine with other steroids such as triamcinolone acetonide has the same disadvantage.\n\n2.13 The respondent's verbal statement that example III of D10 was found to be \"an unworkable and inoperable pharmaceutical formulation\" (see the reply to the appellant's statement of grounds, page 31, fifth paragraph) is not sufficient on its own to demonstrate that the combination of azelastine with triamcinolone is inferior to its combination with ciclesonide, for want of any disclosure of the actual experiment that was carried out and the results that led to the respondent's conclusion. Without this information it cannot be verified whether there is a particular problem with the formulation of example III which can be attributed specifically to triamcinolone acetonide (and/or its combination with azelastine) rather than other formulation components.\n\n2.14 In this context, the respondent also made the following statement (see the reply to the appellant's statement of grounds, page 31, last paragraph):\n\n\"The Opponent has indicated that we did not provide any evidence in support of the fact the example III of D10 was found inoperable. However, the Opponent has now referred to D14 the decision issued in respect of the parent application, which includes results of the example III of D10.\"\n\n2.15 While it is questionable in any case whether a sweeping reference to the decision in another appeal case can be deemed acceptable substantiation when dealing with this kind of concern, it is also apparent from perusing the decision in question that it does not provide the information needed.\n\n2.16 The respondent's argument that the formulation of example II of D10 (which does not contain azelastine) would be expected to have unsuitable osmolality due to its excipient composition is not relevant to the issue of comparing the properties of formulations combining azelastine with varying steroids.\n\n2.17 Since there are no conclusive comparative data on file with regard to the combination of azelastine with triamcinolone acetonide, the alleged technical effect of better stability has not been demonstrated in relation to this alternative starting point.\n\n2.18 Starting from the formulation containing azelastine hydrochloride and triamcinolone acetonide in example III of document D10, the objective technical problem therefore has to be formulated as providing an alternative pharmaceutical formulation comprising a combination of azelastine and a corticosteroid.\n\n2.19 It was not in dispute that the claimed formulation solves this technical problem.\n\nObviousness of the solution\n\n2.20 In order to solve the objective technical problem, the person skilled in the art would have consulted literature about steroids effective in treating allergic disorders affecting the nose and eyes, such as document D6. It would not have been essential for this purpose that the documents consulted for information about steroids also refer to combination therapies.\n\n2.21 Ciclesonide was known at the relevant date as a recently developed topical corticosteroid effective in treating allergic rhinitis (see D6: abstract; page 1063, left-hand column; page 1069, last paragraph).\n\n2.22 On this basis, the person skilled in the art would have regarded ciclesonide as a promising and obvious further option for the choice of steroid.\n\n2.23 The respondent's argument that nothing in D10 would have prompted the person skilled in the art to pick azelastine or its salts as the antihistamine to provide a more stable formulation is not consistent with the objective technical problem (see point 2.18 above) or with the respondent's own suggestion regarding the starting point in D10 (namely a formulation that already includes azelastine; see point XI. above). It is not convincing either. Article 56 EPC requires an invention to be be non-obvious with regard to the prior art, i.e. every piece of prior art. It is therefore appropriate to select a specific embodiment in a document as the most promising starting point in the context of the problem-and-solution approach (in this case: formulations containing azelastine or its salts; see points 2.6 and 2.7 above).\n\n2.24 The respondent further contended that even if better stability were not recognised as a technical effect of the claimed formulations, it would nevertheless have been considered a surprising benefit that the combination of azelastine and ciclesonide, which was not disclosed as such in the prior art, turned out to be stable and effective.\n\n2.25 This argument cannot succeed, for the following reasons.\n\n2.25.1 While this particular drug combination is not suggested in D10, it would nevertheless have been expected to show efficacy in the intended treatment since the therapeutic utility of both azelastine and ciclesonide on their own for treating conditions of the eyes and nose, such as rhinitis and conjunctivitis, was known (as acknowledged by the respondent in the reply to the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, page 17, fifth paragraph).\n\n2.25.2 The respondent's further assertion that the combination of azelastine and ciclesonide was found to have better efficacy (in terms of rapid onset of action and quick relief from symptoms) than monotherapy with either drug is not relevant in this context, since it does not relate to a comparison with the starting point in the prior art (see points 2.7 and 2.8 above) and thus it does not follow the problem-and-solution approach. Hence, it is not permissible, either, to re-formulate the technical problem as \"provision of a combination of an antihistamine and a glucocorticosteroid having a rapid onset of action and quick relief\", as suggested by the respondent.\n\n2.25.3 Furthermore, it has not been shown that the person skilled in the art would have had any specific reason to fear a lack of stability or compatibility with regard to the combination of azelastine and ciclesonide. This was also the respondent's own argument when discussing the issue of post-filed evidence (reply to the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, page 18, first sentence).\n\n2.26 For these reasons, the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request does not involve an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.\n\n3. Auxiliary requests I to VII\n\n3.1 Auxiliary requests I to VII were filed for the first time with the respondent's reply to the statement setting out the grounds of appeal (see points IX. and XII. above).\n\n3.2 The respondent did not explain the purpose of these requests, merely remarking in a general way that each of the auxiliary requests had been filed in response to the appellant's newly filed documents and to the appellant's argument that the alleged technical effect did not provide improvement across the entire scope claimed. No specific explanation was given as to how each request might address any particular inventive-step argument raised by the appellant. The respondent furthermore stated that its comments made in relation to the main request were equally applicable in relation to the auxiliary requests.\n\n3.3 It is not apparent how the various technical features added to claim 1 of each auxiliary request might provide a contribution to inventive step, not did the respondent provide any substantiation in this regard. Therefore, the reasoning on the inventive step of claim 1 of the main request set out in section 2 above equally applies to claim 1 of each of auxiliary requests I to VII.\n\n3.4 In conclusion, the subject-matter of claim 1 of each of auxiliary requests I to VII does not involve an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.\n\n4. Admittance of evidence\n\n4.1 The board's reasoning set out above does not rely on any of documents D15 to D24 filed by the appellant (see point VIII. above).\n\n4.2 Hence, a decision regarding the admittance of documents D15 to D24 under Article 12(4) RPBA-2007 is not required as they are irrelevant to the outcome of the appeal case in the appellant's favour.\n\n4.3 Document D25 filed by the respondent relates to certain excipents used according to D11 and could have no relevance to the board's line of reasoning pursued in points 2.17 ff above.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. European patent No. 2 068 918 (patent in suit) was granted with a set of 18 claims. Independent claim 12 reads as follows:\n\n12. A pharmaceutical composition for use in inducing or enhancing an immune response, comprising:\n\n(a) a glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA); and\n\n(b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient,and wherein the GLA has the formula:\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nwhere:\n\nR**(1), R**(3), R**(5) and R**(6) are C11-C20 alkyl; and\n\nR**(2) and R**(4) are C12-C20 alkyl; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\nII. The patent in suit was opposed under Article 100(a) and (c) EPC on the grounds that the claimed subject-matter lacked novelty and inventive step and extended beyond the content of the application as filed.\n\nIII. The patent proprietor requested that the opposition be rejected, and presented the correct version of the granted claims as its main request. As set out in the patent proprietor's letter dated 30 August 2016 (in the section entitled \"Claim requests\", starting on page 24), this version corrects a publication error in claim 7 of the patent specification (B1) and corresponds to the actual text of the patent as granted. In the course of the opposition proceedings, the patent proprietor also filed further amended sets of claims as auxiliary requests 1 to 3.\n\nIV. Claim 12 of auxiliary request 1 is identical to claim 12 of the main request, except that it further specifies that the composition is for use in inducing or enhancing an immune response \"in a patient\".\n\nV. The documents cited in the proceedings before the opposition division included the following:\n\nD7:  Infection and Immunity, 49(1), 225-237 (1985)\n\nD16:  J Immunother 10(6), 398-404 (1991)\n\nD30: Pharmaceutical Biotechnology - Volume 6 - Vaccine Design - The Subunit and Adjuvant Approach, ed. M.F. Powell & M.J. Newman, Plenum Press, New York and London, Chapter 21, pages 495 to 524 (1995)\n\nD45:  J Med Chem 42, 4640-4649 (1999)\n\nD75:  Declaration of Prof. Rietschel (29 August 2016)\n\nD75a, D75b: Pyrogenicity data (evaluated and raw data) filed by the opponent\n\nVI. The decision under appeal is the opposition division's interlocutory decision rejecting the patent proprietor's main request and auxiliary request 1 and finding that the patent as amended in the form of auxiliary request 2 (comprising claims filed during oral proceedings on 30 September 2016) met the requirements of the EPC.\n\nVII. According to the decision under appeal:\n\n(a) The subject-matter of claim 12 of the main request lacked novelty over a specific compound that was made available to the public before the relevant date and was both in conformity with the formula in claim 12 and suitable for the use stated in the claim (Article 54(2) EPC).\n\n(b) Auxiliary request 1 restricted the use of the composition in claim 12 to in vivo use under Article 54(5) EPC (namely inducing or enhancing an immune response \"in a patient\"). The subject-matter claimed in auxiliary request 1 was found to be novel.\n\n(c) Starting from the technical teaching of document D16, the objective technical problem was to provide an alternative to compound \"504\" disclosed in D16. Modifying the acyl chain length at position R**(4) to be in conformity with the definition in claim 12 of auxiliary request 1 was an arbitrary measure which did not involve an inventive step.\n\n(d) The opposition division admitted new auxiliary request 2 filed at the oral proceedings and held that this request met the requirements of the EPC.\n\nVIII. Both the opponent and the patent proprietor appealed against this decision.\n\nIX. In its notice of appeal and its reply to the patent proprietor's grounds of appeal, the opponent requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be revoked. In the reply to the opponent's appeal, the patent proprietor inter alia defended the amended version of the patent that had been considered allowable in the decision under appeal.\n\nX. The board summoned the parties to oral proceedings, in accordance with their requests.\n\nXI. The opponent withdrew its appeal but did not present any modified requests.\n\nXII. Thus, the patent proprietor remained as the sole appellant while the opponent retained its status as respondent in relation to the patent proprietor's appeal.\n\nXIII. In a communication under Article 15(1) RPBA, issued in preparation for oral proceedings and advising the parties of the board's preliminary opinion, the board addressed inter alia the following points:\n\n(a) Since the opponent had withdrawn its appeal it could no longer pursue a request for revocation of the patent in suit.\n\n(b) The board was of the preliminary view that the subject-matter of claim 12 as granted was novel.\n\n(c) To take account of the objections raised by the opposition division and the opponent (respondent), the board considered it appropriate to assess inventive step starting from the disclosure of document D16.\n\nXIV. Both parties advised the board that they would not be attending the oral proceedings.\n\nXV. The board cancelled the oral proceedings.\n\nXVI. The parties' arguments that are relevant for the present decision relate to the inventive step of the subject-matter of claim 12 in the main request and auxiliary request 1.\n\nXVII. The appellant's arguments may be summarised as follows.\n\nDocument D30 was the closest prior art. Document D16 should not be considered as it was a less promising starting point, and the person skilled in the art would not have chosen D16 as the starting point. Within D16, the compound designated \"MPL\" would have been a better starting point than compound 504.\n\nD16 showed that compound 504 was toxic, or at least five times more toxic than compound MPL, based on the LD50 values in specific mice (D16: Table 3). GLA compositions according to the patent in suit, on the other hand, had been clinically tested in humans and found to be safe, well tolerated and effective.\n\nThe objective technical problem should be formulated as that of providing improved lipid A-type adjuvants suitable for use in vivo, or of finding a synthetic lipid A compound with high immunostimulatory activity and lower toxicity.\n\nAt the priority date, the person skilled in the art would have considered compound 504 to be unsuitable as a vaccine adjuvant for use in humans on the basis of the related data in D16. The field of lipid A-type vaccine adjuvants had been dominated by a structurally different series of (3-O-deacylated) compounds for 15 years, which showed that compound 504 was considered a 'dead end' for research. Furthermore, no suggestion could be found in D16 to modify the acyl chain of compound 504. Different modifications would have been preferred.\n\nThe person skilled in the art would have sought to minimise the toxicity of the adjuvant compounds. D16 itself stated that the differences observed between compounds 504 and MPL were due to the absence of a C16 acyl-oxyacyl fatty acid on the C2 carbon of compound 504 (D16, page 403, last paragraph). At the priority date - 15 years later - it was generally accepted that the absence of acyl chains at the 3-O position was essential for reduced toxicity. The person skilled in the art seeking to solve the objective technical problem starting from compound 504 would have tried these modifications rather than modifying the length of the acyl carbon chains.\n\nIncreasing the number of carbons in one of the acyl chains of compound 504 and arriving at a vaccine (adjuvant) component which was safe and effective for use in humans was therefore surprising and inventive.\n\nXVIII. The respondent's arguments may be summarised as follows.\n\nThe opposition division's assessment of inventive step in the decision under appeal was correct, and neither the main request nor auxiliary request 1 complied with Article 56 EPC.\n\nCompound 504 and its use disclosed in D16 constituted the closest prior art.\n\nThe adjuvant defined in claim 12 differed from compound 504 on account of the length of the acyl chain COR**(4) present at the 2' position.\n\nThe appellant had referred to the toxicity of compound 504 as a disincentive to modifying compound 504. However, the person skilled in the art would have known from the relevant literature that compound 504 was not toxic. They would have considered modifying the acyl chain length to obtain further GLA adjuvants without any expectation of failure.\n\nXIX. The appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the opposition be rejected, i.e. that the patent be maintained as granted; or in the alternative, that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be maintained in amended form on the basis of the claims of auxiliary request 1 filed with the letter dated 27 September 2013, or as amended in the form of auxiliary request 2 considered allowable in the decision under appeal.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. Admissibility of the patent proprietor's appeal\n\nThe appeal complies with Articles 106 to 108 EPC and Rule 99 EPC; it is admissible.\n\n2. Decision without oral proceedings\n\n2.1 Both parties indicated in writing that they would not be attending the oral proceedings (see point XIV. above). The board thus cancelled oral proceedings and decided the case on the basis of the parties' written submissions.\n\n2.2 If a party informs the board that it does not intend to attend the oral proceedings, the board is not obliged to hold oral proceedings in the absence of that party. Rather, under these circumstances, it is within the discretion of the board to decide whether the scheduled oral proceedings are maintained or cancelled.\n\n3. Scope of the appeal case\n\n3.1 Because the opponent withdrew its appeal, its request that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent in suit be revoked (see points IX. and XI. above) can no longer be considered, owing to the principle of prohibition of reformatio in peius.\n\n3.2 As set out in decision G 9/92 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal (OJ EPO 1994, 875), if the patent proprietor is the sole appellant against an interlocutory decision concerning maintenance of a patent in amended form, neither the board of appeal nor the non-appealing opponent may challenge the maintenance of the patent as amended in accordance with the interlocutory decision.\n\n3.3 In the case in hand, this is the version of current auxiliary request 2.\n\n3.4 Thus, the substantive requests to be considered are the main request and auxiliary request 1 of the patent proprietor's appeal.\n\n4. Inventive step\n\nPatent in suit\n\n4.1 The patent in suit relates to the field of pharmaceutical and vaccine compositions, in particular adjuvants for such compositions.\n\n4.2 As set out in paragraphs [0005] to [0007] of the patent in suit, it was well known that enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide was a potent stimulator of the immune system, although its use in adjuvants had been curtailed by toxic effects. Certain non-toxic derivatives or synthetic alternatives suitable for adjuvant use in vaccines were known, for instance monophosphoryl lipid A, diphosphoryl lipid A and 3-O-deacylated variants thereof.\n\n4.3 The patent in suit aims to provide further adjuvants in the general class of lipopolysaccharide analogues that can be manufactured with consistent quality. The solution proposed in the patent is a synthetic glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (\"GLA\") as defined in the claims (see paragraphs [0002], [0008] and [0014]).\n\nClaim analysis\n\n4.4 The main request and auxiliary request 1 each contain several independent claims. For the purposes of the present decision, it is sufficient to focus on claim 12 in each request.\n\n4.5 Claim 12 of auxiliary request 1 is a purpose-related product claim pursuant to Article 54(5) EPC, while claim 12 of the main request is not (see points I. and IV. above for the wording of these claims).\n\n4.5.1 Article 54(5) EPC provides that the patentability of a substance or composition comprised in the state of the art, for any specific use in a method referred to in Article 53(c) EPC, is not excluded, provided that such use is not comprised in the state of the art.\n\n4.5.2 Claim 12 of auxiliary request 1 restricts the use of the composition to inducing or enhancing an immune response \"in a patient\", which is a use referred to in Article 53(c) EPC. In accordance with the claim format and special concept of patentability provided for in Article 54(5) EPC, the therapeutic indication \"use in inducing or enhancing an immune response in a patient\" is a technical feature of the claim that must be taken into account in the assessment of novelty and inventive step.\n\n4.5.3 The special concept according to Article 54(5) EPC does not apply to claim 12 of the main request, which is limited by the \"for use\" feature only in so far as the composition must be suitable for the stated use \"in inducing or enhancing an immune response\". This is because, without the reference to patients, the stated use also covers in vitro methods and is not restricted to methods referred to in Article 53(c) EPC. Qualifying the composition as \"pharmaceutical\" does not necessarily imply that it is used in patients. In vitro use in a cell culture is expressly envisaged in the patent in suit (see paragraph [0158]) and is not ruled out by the definition of the composition or of its use as stated in claim 12 of the main request.\n\nStarting point in the prior art\n\n4.6 One point in dispute was which prior-art disclosure should be regarded as the \"closest\" state of the art.\n\nThe respondent took the view that the disclosure of compound \"504\" in document D16 was the closest prior art and based its objections on this approach.\n\nThe appellant maintained that document D30 was the closest prior art and that D16, being a less promising starting point, should not be considered. If D16 were nevertheless to be considered, its disclosure relating to compound \"MPL\" should be selected as the starting point within that document rather than the disclosure relating to compound 504.\n\n4.7 The board considers that establishing a relative degree of \"closeness\" of these alternative starting points is not crucial. If inventive step is to be acknowledged, the claimed subject-matter must be inventive starting from any potential starting point in the prior art. On the other hand, if inventive step is to be denied, the choice of starting point needs no specific justification.\n\n4.7.1 General considerations\n\nInventive step can, in principle, be assessed starting from any prior-art disclosure. If the starting point is too remote from the claimed subject-matter in terms of purpose and technical features, the problem-and-solution approach will simply not result in a finding that the claimed subject-matter is obvious.\n\nThe usual approach, and the more relevant challenge as a test for inventive step, involves selecting a starting point that relates to the same or a similar purpose or objective as the claimed invention and corresponds as closely as possible to it in terms of technical features. The test is to establish if the claimed subject-matter would have been non-obvious even starting from one or, as the case may be, several such \"promising\" starting points. If this is the case, it may be expected that the claimed subject-matter also involves an inventive step when the assessment is based on more remote starting points.\n\nIn view of the similarity criterion, the starting point is by necessity selected with knowledge of the claimed subject-matter. The selection of a starting point serves the purpose of assessing inventive step and is performed by the body deciding on inventive step, from among the prior-art disclosures that are eligible under Article 56 EPC. Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, either only one starting point or several alternative starting points will be considered.\n\nThus, the starting point in the prior art is not selected by the person skilled in the art. The notional person skilled in the art enters the scenario of the problem-and-solution approach only after the objective technical problem has been determined, as this is the person (or team, as it may be) with suitable competence for solving the objective technical problem.\n\nWhat teaching the skilled person or team seeking to solve the objective technical problem would have derived from the starting point and any supplementary prior-art disclosures, must then be assessed from their point of view before the effective date. In this way, obviousness is assessed without hindsight.\n\n4.7.2 Considerations in relation to the case in hand\n\nIn the decision under appeal, the opposition division considered that the subject-matter of claim 12 of auxiliary request 1 did not involve an inventive step, starting from the technical teaching of document D16.\n\nNeither the opposition division nor the respondent argued that the claimed subject-matter lacked an inventive step starting from the technical teaching of document D30 (favoured by the appellant as the \"closest\" prior art). Their objection was that the claimed subject-matter lacked an inventive step starting from the technical teaching of D16, and in particular the disclosure in D16 relating to compound 504.\n\nAs mentioned above, if an inventive step is to be acknowledged, the claimed subject-matter must be inventive starting from any potential starting point in the prior art.\n\nTo take account of the objections actually raised by the opposition division and the respondent, the board finds it appropriate to assess inventive step starting from the disclosure of D16, specifically compound 504 in that document.\n\nIn particular, for the appeal to be allowable, the board must be convinced that an inventive step can be acknowledged in an assessment that is based on the same starting point as the opposition division's assessment that led to a negative conclusion on inventive step in the decision under appeal.\n\nThe question whether the disclosure relating to compound 504 in document D16 might be considered the \"closest\" prior art is therefore immaterial.\n\nThe appellant contended that the person skilled in the art would not have selected compound 504 as a starting point because D16 taught that it was more toxic than MPL. In view of the considerations set out in point 4.7.1 above, the premise for this argument (namely that it is the person skilled in the art who selects the starting point for the assessment of inventive step) is not followed, and the argument is considered not relevant at this stage of the problem-and-solution approach. What teaching the skilled person would have inferred from the disclosure in D16 about the properties of compound 504 is, however, relevant for the assessment of obviousness, and this aspect is considered in point 4.17 below.\n\nContent of D16\n\n4.8 D16 relates to a comparison of the immunomodulating properties of two forms of monophosphoryl lipid A analogues considered to be adjuvant candidates, one of which is a synthetic substance designated compound \"504\" (see D16: title and abstract). The other compound is designated \"MPL\" and was isolated from bacterial cell walls.\n\nThe formula of compound 504 is disclosed in document D7 (Fig. 1), which is referenced in D16 as reference 21. It was not in dispute that compound 504 is in conformity with the formula in claim 12 except for the definition of R**(4), which in compound 504 is a C11 alkyl chain rather than a C12-C20 alkyl chain.\n\nD16 reports that, after being formulated as aqueous solutions, the compounds were tested on mice and cell cultures and were found to have excellent immunomodulatory activity in multiple assays. The two compounds investigated in D16 were also deemed to have comparatively low toxicity. The authors of D16 concluded from the observed results that monophosphoryl analogues of lipid A were suitable candidates for immunotherapy and vaccine adjuvants.\n\nObjective technical problem and solution\n\n4.9 The compositions according to claim 12 of the main request and auxiliary request 1 differ from the compositions containing compound 504 described in D16 on account of the structure of the GLA adjuvant with regard to the chain length of substituent R**(4).\n\n4.10 According to the appellant, the technical effect associated with the increased chain length of substituent R**(4) in the compounds according to the patent in suit was lower toxicity.\n\n4.11 However, the alleged lower toxicity was not shown, at least not across the scope of GLA compounds as defined in claim 12.\n\n4.11.1 The appellant did not provide any comparative test that allowed the toxicity of the GLA compounds according to claim 12 to be directly compared with the toxicity of compound 504.\n\n4.11.2 In the proceedings before the opposition division, the respondent provided document D75a, which contains data relating to the pyrogenicity of compound 504 and compound \"PHADTM\", a compound according to claim 12. The sole difference between these compounds is that R**(4) is C11 alkyl in compound 504 but is C13 alkyl in PHAD.\n\nAs shown in D75a and as set out in the accompanying expert declaration D75 (conclusions in point 12), compound 504 and PHAD showed similar pyrogenicity profiles, with each compound being about 100 times less pyrogenic than compound \"506\", a synthetic form of lipid A that expresses all the toxic activities of bacterial lipopolysaccharides and that was included in the test as a positive control.\n\nThe appellant argued in point 6.6 of its reply to the opponent's appeal that the data in D75a and the corresponding raw data provided in D75b still suggested that PHAD was less pyrogenic than compound 504.\n\nEven if that were the case (D75, in point 12, acknowledges that \"compound 504 appeared to be somewhat more active in the pyrogen tests than PHADTM\", and the respondent, in its grounds of appeal, second paragraph on page 41, speaks of \"PHAD having slightly decreased toxicity as compared to compound 504\"), it has not been shown that such a finding can be extrapolated to all the compounds covered by the formula in claim 12 (i.e. having substituents R**(4) with chain lengths of C12-20 alkyl).\n\nThe scientific journal article D45 does not provide any information that could support such extrapolation. D45 reports research into the effect of varying the carbon chain length of secondary acyloxy chains in certain monophosphoryl lipid A compounds. However, the compound class examined according to D45 has an acylation pattern that is distinct from that of the GLA compounds according to the patent in suit. Furthermore, several chain lengths were varied simultaneously, within a range of shorter chain lengths of 4 to 14 carbons. On account of these fundamental differences, the board considers that D45 does not provide a generally applicable concept that could be predictive of the effect that chain length in substituent R**(4)has on the toxicity of the compounds according to claim 12. For this reason, it would not be correct to extrapolate any of the findings in D45 to GLA.\n\n4.12 As a consequence, the alleged technical effect of lower toxicity cannot be used in the formulation of the objective technical problem.\n\n4.13 No comparative data relating to other properties of the compounds of claim 12 were provided.\n\n4.14 Starting from the disclosure of document D16 in relation to compound 504, the objective technical problem applying to claim 12 of the main request is thus to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising an alternative GLA compound, suitable for inducing or enhancing an immune response.\n\nThe objective technical problem in the case of claim 12 of auxiliary request 1 is to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising an alternative GLA compound, for use in inducing or enhancing an immune response in a patient.\n\n4.15 The respondent argued (as did the opposition division) that efficacy of the compositions as vaccine adjuvants was not credibly attained across the claimed scope.\n\n4.16 In the board's view, this argument must fail because the technical effect in question is expressed in the claims.\n\nIn a purpose-related product claim according to Article 54(5) EPC, like claim 12 of auxiliary request 1, attaining the therapeutic benefit stated in the claim is a technical feature of the claim, i.e. only compositions which attain the therapeutic benefit are claimed.\n\nClaim 12 of the main request likewise states the intended use of the composition in inducing or enhancing an immune response and defines component (a) as an adjuvant, which translates into a requirement of suitability (of both component (a) and the pharmaceutical composition) for the stated purpose.\n\nThus the wording of the claims implies that the objective technical problems as defined in point 4.14 above are solved across the claimed scope.\n\nThe objection that adjuvant efficacy was not demonstrated across the range of compounds defined by the formula in claim 12 should instead have been raised and addressed under Article 100(b) EPC (sufficiency of disclosure) rather than Articles 100(a) and 56 EPC (inventive step) (see decision G 1/03, OJ EPO 2004, 413, Reasons 2.5.2).\n\nObviousness of the solution\n\n4.17 As already mentioned (see the last paragraph of point 4.7.2 above), the appellant argued that D16 showed that compound 504 was toxic, or at least five times more toxic than MPL, based on the LD50 values in specific mice, reported in Table 3 of D16. The person skilled in the art would thus have considered that compound 504 was unsafe and unsuitable for use in humans.\n\n4.18 The board notes that contrary to the appellant's view, document D16 is in fact fairly optimistic about the suitability of compound 504 for stimulating an immune response and as a vaccine adjuvant (as also pointed out by the respondent in point 4.2.2 of its submission of 28 April 2017).\n\nD16 reports that both compound 504 and MPL exhibited considerably reduced toxicity in LD50 assays when compared with native lipopolysaccharides (LPS), when tested in the particularly sensitive, galactosamine-loaded C57BL/6 murine strain (see D16: abstract, Table 3, paragraph bridging pages 403 and 404). While the LD50 for MPL was found to be 226 times higher and that for compound 504 40 times higher than that for native LPS, D16 does not suggest at any point that compound 504 was considered unsafe and toxic on account of this difference. As both compounds also exhibited excellent immunomodulatory activity, they were considered to be non-toxic candidates for immunotherapy and vaccine adjuvants (paragraph bridging pages 403 and 404; see also the abstract: \"analogues of bacterial lipopolysaccharides with little or no toxicity\").\n\nThus, D16 failed to reproduce the more unfavourable test results regarding compound 504 that are reported in the earlier publication D7 (cited in D16 as reference 21). In the passage that mentions D7, D16 also emphasises that compound 504 was found to be much less toxic and pyrogenic than native lipid A and its diphosphoryl analogue (see D16: paragraph bridging pages 398 and 399).\n\nIn conclusion, the teaching in the prior art, in particular in D16, would not have given the skilled person the impression that compound 504 was particularly toxic, or that compounds with minor structural variations based on compound 504 would turn out to be unacceptably toxic.\n\n4.19 The appellant also argued that compound 504, at the priority date of the patent in suit, was considered a 'dead end' for research, as the field of lipid A-type vaccine adjuvant research had been dominated for years by the 3-O-deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A series.\n\n4.20 However, this argument remains circumstantial and speculative, as no evidence of a general technical prejudice against compound 504 and related compounds has been presented. Even if research in the technical field had been focused for a time on 3-O-deacylated compounds, this alone, without corresponding statements in the prior art, does not prove that compound 504 was generally considered a 'dead end' that should not be explored further.\n\n4.21 In order to solve the objective technical problem starting from compound 504 in D16, the person skilled in the art would have tried to obtain alternative GLA compounds by systematically varying the structure of compound 504, i.e. by merely applying routine measures.\n\n4.22 One option for doing this, lying within the skilled person's routine, was to vary acyl chain lengths, for example by varying the chain length of substituent R**(4). In this manner, the person skilled in the art would have arrived at the claimed subject-matter.\n\n4.23 As set out above, the appellant failed to show that the person skilled in the art would have had an expectation of failure that would have kept them from trying this modification.\n\n4.24 While other structural modifications were likewise possible, such as varying the acylation pattern, this does not mean that the skilled person would not have also varied acyl chain lengths in order to provide alternative GLA compounds. This option would have been an arbitrary choice that cannot establish an inventive step.\n\n4.25 These considerations apply equally to claim 12 of the main request and claim 12 of auxiliary request 1 and the respective objective technical problems defined in point 4.14 above.\n\n4.26 As a consequence, the subject-matter of claim 12 of the main request and claim 12 of auxiliary request 1 does not involve an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The appellant (applicant) lodged an appeal against the decision of the examining division refusing European patent application No. 10 726 573.8.\n\nII. Claim 1 of the main request in these appeal proceedings, filed with the statement of grounds of appeal, reads as follows:\n\n\"A fluid composition comprising:\n\na) a hyaluronan polymer, wherein the hyaluronan polymer is present at a concentration of 11.5 mg/mL to 15.5 mg/mL, and wherein the hyaluronan polymer is uncrosslinked and constitutes at least 95% by weight of the total hyaluronan polymer present in the composition; and\n\nb) a mannitol; wherein the mannitol is present at a concentration of 2.0% (w/v) to 5% (w/v) of the composition.\"\n\nIII. The documents cited by the examining division include the following:\n\nD3    WO 2004/073759 A1\n\nD5    WO 2008/077172 A2\n\nIV. The examining division concluded that claim 1 of the main request and of the first auxiliary request before it was not novel.\n\nWith respect to the composition of claim 1 of the second and third auxiliary requests, which corresponds to claim 1 of the main request in these appeal proceedings, document D3 was the closest prior art. D3 disclosed a composition containing uncrosslinked hyaluronic acid and mannitol. It also disclosed that mannitol had a stabilising effect, but did not disclose the mannitol concentration required by claim 1. The evidence on file did not show an improvement in terms of hyaluronic acid stability of the claimed composition with respect to the ones of D3, which was therefore an arbitrary selection over those of D3 and not inventive.\n\nV. The arguments of the appellant relevant for the present decision were as follows.\n\nD3 was the closest prior art and did not disclose the mannitol concentration required by claim 1. The problem underlying the claimed invention was to provide hyaluronic compositions having better stability. The claimed solution, characterised by the relative amount of mannitol (2.0% to 5% w/v), credibly solved the problem of providing better stability having regard to the data in Table 4 of the application. The skilled person would have considered the relative amount of mannitol disclosed in D3, namely 0.2% to 1.0%, to be a \"sweet point\" which balanced mannitol stabilising effect with other factors. There was no teaching in D3 that stabilisation could increase with mannitol concentration. For these reasons, the claimed solution was inventive.\n\nVI. Oral proceedings before the board of appeal took place on 24 September 2020.\n\nVII. The appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted with the claims of the main request, filed with the statement setting out the grounds of appeal dated 22 November 2018.\n\nVIII. At the end of the oral proceedings, the decision was announced.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeal is admissible.\n\n2. Inventive step\n\n2.1 Claim 1 relates to a composition comprising uncrosslinked hyaluronan polymer, at a concentration of 11.5 mg/mL to 15.5 mg/mL, and mannitol at a concentration of 2.0% (w/v) to 5% (w/v) of the composition.\n\n2.2 Closest prior art\n\nThe appellant agreed with the examining division that document D3 was the closest prior art, and the board sees no reason to differ.\n\nIt has not been disputed that document D3 discloses hyaluronic acid compositions which differ from those of claim 1 only by virtue of the concentration of mannitol, which is 0.2% to 1% and thus less than required by claim 1. D3 discloses that mannitol stabilises the composition (page 4, lines 4-7; page 6, lines 14-18).\n\n2.3 Technical problem underlying the invention\n\nThe appellant formulated the technical problem underlying the claimed invention as providing a hyaluronan polymer composition having improved stability.\n\n2.4 Solution\n\nThe solution to this technical problem composition of claim 1, comprising a hyaluronan polymer and mannitol and characterised in that the mannitol concentration is 2.0% (w/v) to 5% (w/v).\n\n2.5 Success\n\nIn the following, it will be examined whether the subject-matter of claim 1 is inventive on the assumption that the technical problem as formulated by the appellant has been credibly solved by the features of claim 1.\n\n2.6 It thus remains to be decided whether the proposed solution would have been obvious for the skilled person in view of D3.\n\nDocument D3 discloses that mannitol increases the stability of hyaluronic acid (page 6, lines 14-18) and acts as radical scavenger (page 6, lines 19-22). D3 discloses mannitol as stabiliser in the broadest sense (claim 1), and does not disclose any measure which could stabilise hyaluronic acid other than the presence of mannitol.\n\nThe skilled person having regard to the stabilising role of mannitol disclosed in D3 and trying to enhance the stability of compositions comprising hyaluronic acid and mannitol, would have increased the relative amount of stabilising mannitol, and would thus have arrived at the claimed invention without using inventive skills.\n\n2.7 The appellant argued that D1 had a specific teaching with respect to the amounts of mannitol to be used as stabiliser. Lacking any experimental evidence and any explanation on the mechanism, the skilled person would have concluded that no further stabilisation could have been obtained beyond the upper limit of 1%.\n\n2.8 However, document D3 discloses that mannitol is a radical scavenger. The skilled person would thus have considered this property as underlying the stabilising effect.\n\nIt could be envisaged, as argued by the appellant, that any stabilising effect would not necessarily have increased if the concentration of mannitol went beyond that disclosed in D3, so that D3 disclosed the upper limit for achieving that effect. However, it would be within the skills of the person of the art to check whether or not this was the case. By doing so, it would inevitably have arrived at the claimed invention.\n\nThe arguments of the appellant are thus not convincing.\n\n2.9 The appellant also argued that D3 did not contain any experimental data. The skilled person would thus have no expectation of success linked to a higher concentration of mannitol.\n\nHowever, the skilled person would either have taken the information in D3 at face value, or carry out experiments in order to corroborate the stabilising effect alleged in D3. Once the stabilising effect is either accepted at face value or corroborated, increasing the amount of mannitol to increase stability would have been an obvious option.\n\n2.10 Lastly, the appellant relied on document D5, which disclosed on the passage bridging pages 2 and 3 and with explicit reference to D3 that mannitol could diffuse out of the hyaluronic acid depot. Also for this reason, the skilled person would not have increased its concentration in the composition, as it could have led to undesired effects.\n\nHowever, if stabilising mannitol diffuses out of the depot, the obvious manner to compensate for the reduced stabilising effect at the depot would actually be to increase its concentration. This argument is also not convincing.\n\n2.11 Claim 1 of the sole request of the appellant is thus not inventive, as required by Article 56 EPC, and the appellant's request is not allowable.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The decision under appeal is the opposition division's decision revoking European patent No. 2 451 462.\n\nThe decision was based on the claims of a main request and four auxiliary requests. The opposition division concluded, among other things, that the amendments of the main request were allowable and that the claimed subject-matter was sufficiently disclosed and novel but did not involve an inventive step. The subject-matter of auxiliary requests 1 to 3 did not involve an inventive step either. Auxiliary request 4 was admitted, but its amendments were unallowable and the claimed subject-matter was also not inventive.\n\nII. The patent proprietors (appellants) filed an appeal against the opposition division's decision. With their statement of grounds of appeal, the appellants filed five sets of claims as their main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 4. The requests were identical to the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 4 on which the decision under appeal was based.\n\nClaim 1 of the main request reads as follows:\n\n\"1. A milk-derived oligosaccharide-for use in treating ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or irritable bowel syndrome, wherein the milk-derived oligosaccharide is 2'-fucosyllactose, or a variant thereof, the variant being identical to 2'-fucosyllactose except that\n\nthe reducing end is N-acetylglucosamine instead of glucose.\"\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 1 differs from claim 1 of the main request in that the milk-derived oligosaccharide has been limited to 2'-fucosyllactose.\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 2 differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 in that the expression \"an inflammatory disease selected from the group consisting of\" has been inserted before the recited diseases.\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 3 differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 in that the diseases have been limited to \"ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease\".\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 4 differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 in that the diseases have been limited to \"ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease\" (emphasis added by the board).\n\nIII. In their replies to the statement of grounds of appeal, opponents 1 and 2 (respondents 1 and 2) requested that the appeal be dismissed.\n\nIV. The board scheduled oral proceedings in line with the parties' requests and issued a communication drawing attention to salient issues that might be debated at the oral proceedings.\n\nV. With a letter dated 7 December 2022, respondent 2 announced that it would not be attending the oral proceedings.\n\nVI. Oral proceedings were held by videoconference on 10 February 2023 in the absence of respondent 2. At the end of the oral proceedings, the board announced its decision.\n\nVII. The appellants' arguments relevant to the present decision can be summarised as follows.\n\nApplying the gold standard, claim 1 of the main request did not add subject-matter. A reading of the application as a whole made the link between 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) and the diseases ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome clear and unambiguous.\n\nThe claim was based on a limitation of claim 1 as filed by incorporating 2'-FL (and its N-acetylglucosamine variant) from claim 3 and the inflammatory diseases ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome from claim 21. The amendment did not provide any new technical teaching and involved a single selection. The compound 2'-FL was selected from among the preferred milk-derived oligosaccharides, but no additional selection was made when indicating the treated diseases. Indeed, it was obvious from the dependency of claim 21 on claim 20 that the diseases in claim 1 were the most preferred ones.\n\nAdditional support could be found in the description on page 4 in Table 1, on page 6, lines 20 to 23, and on page 8, lines 24 to 26. Claim 1 was also consistent with the examples in the application as filed, in which a fraction of human-milk oligosaccharides containing 2'-FL was isolated and tested for its ability to inhibit intestinal inflammation.\n\nVIII. The respondents' arguments relevant to the present decision can be summarised as follows.\n\nClaim 1 of the main request added subject-matter. There was no clear and unambiguous link between 2'-FL and ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome in the application as filed. The features had not been disclosed in combination, the compound 2'-FL was not the most preferred milk-derived oligosaccharide and nor were ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome the most preferred diseases.\n\nThere was no direct dependency between claims 3 and 21 as filed. The compounds of claim 3 had the same level of preference as those listed in claims 6 to 8, 10, 12, 15 and 17. As to claim 21, its dependency on claim 20 was obviously wrong. Both claims 20 and 21 were actually dependent on claim 19, and each of them disclosed a different and equally preferred group of diseases. This was confirmed by the description on page 8, lines 17 to 26. The examples in the application as filed did not support the appellants' case, since they related to a mixture of human-milk oligosaccharides and were silent as regards the presence of 2'-FL or the claimed selection of treated diseases in claim 1.\n\nIX. The parties' final requests relevant to the present decision are the following.\n\n- The appellants requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be maintained in amended form on the basis of the main request or, alternatively, on the basis of one of auxiliary requests 1 to 4, all filed with the statement of grounds of appeal.\n\n- The respondents requested that the appeal be dismissed.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC) - main request\n\n1.1 The board agrees with the appellants that the standard of disclosure to be applied for assessing whether amendments add subject-matter beyond the content of the application as filed is the gold standard, as last confirmed by the Enlarged Board of Appeal in decision G 1/16 (Reasons 17 to 20). This standard is defined as:\n\n\"what a skilled person would derive directly and unambiguously, using common general knowledge and seen objectively and relative to the date of filing, from the whole of these documents as filed\".\n\n1.2 On this issue, the main point of dispute between the parties was whether the application as filed directly and unambiguously disclosed a link between the milk-derived oligosaccharide 2'-FL and the treatment of the diseases ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nAccording to the appellants, a basis for this combination of features in the application as filed could be found in the limitation of claim 1 by incorporating features from claims 3 and 21. Although claims 3 and 21 were not directly linked, they were both (indirectly) dependent on claim 1. The combination of claims 3 and 21 involved a single selection, namely the choice of 2'-FL from among the preferred milk-derived oligosaccharides. The limitation to the diseases of claim 21 did not involve a selection, because the diseases were the most preferred ones.\n\n1.3 Claim 1 as filed reads as follows:\n\n\"1. A method of inhibiting inflammation, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition containing at least a milk-derived oligosaccharide or a glycoconjugate containing the oligosaccharide, the oligosaccharide including a first sugar unit and a second sugar unit, wherein the first sugar unit, located at a first non-reducing end, is fucose, galactose, mannose, or sialic acid and the second sugar unit, linked to the first sugar unit, is galactose, glucose, mannose, or N-acetylglucosamine.\"\n\n1.4 Limitation to 2'-FL as the milk-derived oligosaccharide\n\nThe respondents argued that the application as filed did not disclose 2'-FL as being the most preferred milk-derived oligosaccharide but just one of those preferred. This was not contested by the appellants, which conceded, at the oral proceedings before the board, that the limitation of the milk-derived oligosaccharide to 2'-FL involved a selection.\n\nThe board agrees. The claims as filed disclose three groups of equally preferred milk-derived oligosaccharides according to claim 1, namely those in which:\n\n- the first sugar unit of the oligosaccharide is fucose (claim 2),\n\n- the oligosaccharide includes a second non-reducing end (claim 4), and\n\n- the first sugar unit of the oligosaccharide is sialic acid (claim 11).\n\nPreferred oligosaccharides within each of these groups are disclosed in claims 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15 and 17. The compound 2'-FL is one of the embodiments in claim 3 as filed.\n\nOther elements of the application as filed cited by the parties in this context were the first entry of Table 1 on page 4, and the passage on page 6, lines 20 to 23. These elements mention 2'-FL but do not state that it has a higher preference than other preferred milk-derived oligosaccharides. Table 1 discloses 2'-FL as one compound within a list of fucosyl oligosaccharides that naturally occur in human milk according to cited prior-art documents. The passage on page 6, lines 20 to 23, refers to 2'-FL as one among several examples of milk-derived oligosaccharides that can be used for forming glycoconjugates via a reducing sugar.\n\nTherefore, 2'-FL is just one of the numerous preferred milk-derived oligosaccharides disclosed in the application as filed.\n\n1.5 Limitation to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome as the diseases to be treated\n\nClaims 19 to 21 as filed disclose the diseases that may be treated by the method of claim 1. The claims read as follows:\n\n\"19. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject suffers from or is at risk for an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.\"\n\n\"20. The method of claim 19, wherein the inflammatory disease of the digestive tract is selected from the group consisting of oesophagitis, gastroenteritis, colitis, cholangitis, and appendicitis.\"\n\n\"21. The method of claim 20, wherein the inflammatory disease of the digestive tract is ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or irritable bowel syndrome.\"\n\nIt is clear to the skilled reader that the diseases recited in claim 21 do not constitute a sub-group of the diseases in claim 20 but are, instead, a different group of inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract. The skilled person would have realised that the reference by claim 21 to claim 20 was obviously a mistake and that claim 21 should refer back to claim 19.\n\nThis view is confirmed by the passage on page 8, lines 6 to 26 of the application as filed, which discloses the same two groups of inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract separately and at the same level of preference. The passage states that the method of the invention is particularly effective in treating inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract, including oesophagitis, gastroenteritis, colitis, cholangitis and appendicitis. In the next sentence, the passage adds that inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract also include inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nOn page 2, lines 19 to 22, the application recites the two groups of diseases within a single list - at the same level of preference - as examples of diseases of the digestive tract.\n\nThus, inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract are preferred in the application as filed, but the sub-group consisting of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome is not the most preferred sub-group. It represents a selection equivalent to that of the sub-group consisting of oesophagitis, gastroenteritis, colitis, cholangitis and appendicitis.\n\n1.6 The appellants cited the examples in the application as filed as additional support for the claimed subject-matter. However, the examples do not help since they merely disclose the in-vitro effect of a fraction of human-milk oligosaccharides of undetermined composition in inhibiting intestinal inflammation. The examples are silent as to both the presence of 2'-FL in the isolated oligosaccharide fraction and the treatment of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n1.7 It follows from points 1.4 to 1.6 above that the application as filed does not disclose a clear and unambiguous link between 2'-FL and ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome. Thus, the skilled person could not clearly and unambiguously derive from the application as filed that the invention concerned the use of 2'-FL for treating the three specific diseases.\n\nTherefore, claim 1 of the main request adds subject-matter and does not comply with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.\n\n2. Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC) - auxiliary requests\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary requests 1 and 2 contains the combination of 2'-FL with the treatment of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome. In claim 1 of auxiliary requests 3 and 4, the compound 2'-FL is combined with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\n\nTherefore, for the reasons explained in relation to the main request, claim 1 of each of auxiliary requests 1 to 4 also adds subject-matter.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The decision under appeal is the opposition division's decision rejecting the opposition filed against\n\nEuropean patent No. 2 300 013.\n\nII. The patent had been granted with 24 claims.\n\nClaim 1 as granted was directed to a compound of the following generic formula:\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nwherein X**(1) is N; X**(3) is CR**(d); X**(4) is CR**(e); Ring A and Ring E are each phenyl rings; L is NH; s is 1, 2, or 3; and\n\np is 1, 2, or 3 (see the patent for the definition of R**(a), R**(d), R**(e) and R**(g)).\n\nClaim 14 as granted was limited to the following compound according to claim 1:\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nThis compound is commonly known as brigatinib.\n\nClaims 15 to 24 as granted were directed to different aspects of brigatinib, namely its pharmaceutically acceptable salts (claim 15), pharmaceutical compositions (claim 17), therapeutic uses (claims 16 and 19), methods of preparation (claims 20 to 22) and synthetic intermediates (claims 23 and 24).\n\nIII. The patent was opposed on the grounds of Article 100(a), for lack of inventive step, 100(b) and 100(c) EPC.\n\nIn the appealed decision, the opposition division concluded that the patent as granted did not add subject-matter. Furthermore, the claimed subject-matter was sufficiently disclosed and involved an inventive step starting from document D8 (WO 2004/080980 A1) as the closest prior art.\n\nIV. The opponent (appellant) filed an appeal requesting that the opposition division's decision be set aside and that the patent be revoked in its entirety.\n\nV. With its reply to the statement of grounds of appeal, the patent proprietor (respondent) requested that the appeal be dismissed. In addition, it maintained the sets of claims filed as auxiliary requests 1 to 7 with the letter dated 29 October 2018, and filed new sets of claims as auxiliary requests 8 to 11.\n\nVI. The board scheduled oral proceedings, in line with the parties' requests, and gave its preliminary opinion.\n\nVII. The parties made written submissions in response to the board's preliminary opinion.\n\nVIII. Oral proceedings were held before the board on 4 November 2022. At the oral proceedings, the respondent made the claim set filed as auxiliary request 1 with the letter dated 29 October 2018 its main request.\n\nThis main request contains ten claims and its subject-matter is identical to that of claims 14 to 24 as granted. Claim 1 is directed to brigatinib or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\nAt the end of the oral proceedings the board announced its decision.\n\nIX. The appellant's arguments relevant to the present decision can be summarised as follows.\n\nDocument D8 was the closest prior art. The application as filed did not credibly show that brigatinib was an ALK inhibitor; the test results on page 235 neither included brigatinib nor demonstrated a structure-activity relationship allowing the conclusion that brigatinib was an ALK inhibitor. A structural modification of the compounds shown to be active would disrupt biological activity.\n\nTherefore, no technical effect could be acknowledged for brigatinib and the objective technical problem had to be defined as the provision of further compounds. Brigatinib was merely an arbitrary compound.\n\nX. The respondent's arguments relevant to the present decision can be summarised as follows.\n\nStarting from D8 as the closest prior art, the subject-matter of the main request differed in the structure of brigatinib. The technical effect provided by this difference was the inhibition of ALK. The effect had been credibly demonstrated by the structure-activity relationship derivable from the ALK inhibitors disclosed on page 235 of the application as filed.\n\nTherefore, the objective technical problem was the provision of alternative kinase inhibitors, in particular ALK inhibitors, for the treatment of cancer. The appellant had not disputed that brigatinib was a non-obvious solution to this problem.\n\nXI. The parties' final requests were the following:\n\n- The appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be revoked in its entirety.\n\n- The respondent requested that the patent be maintained in amended form on the basis of the claims of the main request, filed as auxiliary request 1 with the letter dated 29 October 2018.\n\nAlternatively, the respondent requested that the patent be maintained either as granted or as amended according to the claims of one of auxiliary requests 2 to 7, filed with the letter dated 29 October 2018, and auxiliary requests 8 to 11, filed with the reply to the statement of grounds of appeal.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeal is admissible. It meets the requirements of Articles 106 to 108 and Rule 99(2) EPC.\n\n2. Claim 1 of the main request - inventive step\n\n2.1 It was common ground between the parties that D8 is a suitable starting point for the assessment of inventive step.\n\nLike the patent, D8 (Formula I on page 1, in which A is most preferably C) is directed to compounds having a 2,4-di(phenylamino)-pyrimidine core structure and to their use for the treatment of cancer. The compounds of D8 (page 15, penultimate paragraph to page 17, second paragraph) are inhibitors of FAK, but some of them are also inhibitors of ZAP-70, IGR-IR and ALK (page 17, third paragraph to page 18, first paragraph). In the experimental part of D8, illustrative compounds were tested as FAK, ZAP-70 and IGR-IR inhibitors (see Examples 53 to 59 on pages 155 to 161 and the summary on pages 164 to 170). According to page 20, first paragraph, some compounds were also tested for ALK inhibition.\n\n2.2 Brigatinib (the compound of claim 1) differs from the compounds in D8 in its specific structure, especially in that it bears a dimethylphosphoryl group on the phenyl ring of the substituent at position 4 of the pyrimidine ring. D8 does not contemplate the possibility of this phenyl ring bearing a phosphorous-based substituent (see the definition of substituents R**(0) to R**(3) on page 1 of D8).\n\n2.3 The technical effect produced by this difference was disputed by the parties. The appellant contested the respondent's position that the application as filed credibly shows that brigatinib is an ALK inhibitor.\n\nThe board agrees with the respondent for the following reasons.\n\nOn page 235, the application as filed reported the structure of 12 compounds found to have IC50 values under 1 nM when tested for ALK inhibition. The compounds have been designated as A1 to D3 in the figure below.\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nA comparison of pyrimidine-based compounds A1, A2, A3, B3, C3, D1 and D2 reveals that the following core structure is an important feature for inhibiting ALK:\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nThis core structure appears to tolerate a certain variability of substituents R1 and R2 without losing its ALK inhibitory effect; R1 can be dimethylphosphoryl (D1 and A3), isopropylsulfonyl (B3 and D2) or methoxy with an additional phosphorous-based substituent at the p-position of the phenyl ring (A1, A2 and C3), while R2 can be one of the following groups (in A1, A2, A3, B3, C3, D1 and D2, respectively):\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHICFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHICFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHICFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHICFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nThis variability of substituents without loss of the ALK inhibitory effect is also confirmed in the analogous pyrrolopyrimidine-based compounds B1, C1, C2 and D3.\n\nBrigatinib is structurally closely related to the pyrimidine-based compounds above; it has the same core structure, with R1 dimethylphosphoryl and R2 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl (second substituent from the left, i.e. R2 of A2).\n\nTherefore, although brigatinib was not tested in the application as filed, the structure-activity relationship derivable from the results presented on page 235 let the reader expect that it inhibits ALK to a similar extent to compounds A1, A2, A3, B3, C3, D1 and D2. This appears particularly likely when comparing the structure of compounds having the same R1 and looking at the variability of R2 without loss of activity. For instance, compounds D1 and A3 which, like brigatinib, have R1 dimethylphosphoryl, have a significantly different R2 without loss of activity, namely:\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC     FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nTherefore, the results presented on page 235 provide (indirect) evidence that R2 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl) piperidin-1-yl, which did not impair activity in A2, will also be non-detrimental when R1 is dimethylphosphoryl, as in brigatinib.\n\nThe board therefore holds that, contrary to the appellant's view, the experimental results in the application as filed demonstrate a structure-activity relationship which allows the conclusion that brigatinib is an ALK inhibitor.\n\n2.4 The problem can then be formulated as the provision of an alternative ALK inhibitor.\n\n2.5 On the basis of the board's conclusion, the appellant accepted that the experimental results in the application as filed made it credible that brigatinib is an ALK inhibitor, and that brigatinib was not an obvious solution to the technical problem of providing an alternative ALK inhibitor starting from the disclosure of document D8. It did not, therefore, raise any argument in this respect.\n\nThe board agrees that brigatinib is a non-obvious solution to the skilled person seeking alternative ALK inhibitors, since there is no hint in D8 of the modifications required to arrive at brigatinib, let alone to provide a new ALK inhibitor.\n\n3. During the oral proceedings before the board, the appellant confirmed that it had no inventive step objections against any of the independent claims of the main request other than claim 1.\n\n4. Therefore, the board concluded that the subject-matter of the main request involves an inventive step and meets the requirement of Article 56 EPC. As no further objections were raised in appeal proceedings against the main request, it follows that the patent is to be maintained on the basis of the main request.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. European patent No. 2 367 521 was granted on the basis of a set of 32 claims.\n\nII. An opposition was filed under Article 100 (a) EPC against the granted patent on the grounds that the subject-matter of the granted patent lacked novelty and inventive step.\n\nIII. The appeal lies from the decision of the opposition division finding that the patent in amended form met the requirements of the EPC. The decision was based on the main request filed on 4 September 2014.\n\nIndependent claim 1 of the main request read:\n\n\"1. A cosmetic antiperspirant composition comprising from 5 to 30% by weight of an astringent antiperspirant salt, from 40 to 80% by weight of a continuous liquid phase comprising at least one water-immiscible oil and from 5 to 30% by weight of a gellant for the carrier liquid selected from fatty alcohol waxes, and containing at least 0.1 % by weight of at least one aliphatic dihydric or trihydric moisturiser having a molecular weight of not greater than 620 and/or at least 0.1 % by weight of a triglyceride oil, which composition further containing at least 0.25% by weight of a mica pigment dispersed within the continuous liquid phase.\"\n\nIV. The documents cited during the opposition proceedings included the following:\n\nD1: EP 2090284 A1\n\nD4: US 2008/0152608 A1\n\nD5: US 2004/0091439 A1\n\nD6: US 2006/0051304 A1\n\nD7: DE 10 2005 026034 A1\n\nV. According to the decision under appeal:\n\n(a) Claim 1 of the main request was novel over D1.\n\n(b) As regards inventive step, D7 was preferred over D4 as closest prior art, and disclosed a stearyl alcohol structured antiperspirant comprising 20 wt% antiperspirant salt, 18 wt% of stearyl alcohol and 56.9 wt% of oils (see example 1). The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request and the disclosure of D7 were the presence of at least 0.1 % of an aliphatic dihydric or trihydric moisturizer with a molecular weight of less than 620 and/or at least 0.1 % of a triglyceride oil, and the presence of at least 0.25 wt% of a mica pigment. With regard to the latter difference, the experimental data of the description of the specification showed an improvement in perceived skin appearance in terms of skin tone, radiance or smoothness of axillary skin. Thus, the technical problem was the improvement of the visual appearance of the treated skin. The solution was not obvious, in particular in view of the teaching of D5 and D6.\n\nVI. The opponent (hereinafter the appellant) filed an appeal against said decision.\n\nVII. In their reply to the statement of grounds of appeal dated 17 August 2016, the patent proprietors (hereinafter the respondents) requested that the appeal be dismissed.\n\nVIII. With a letter dated 12 June 2020, the respondents filed auxiliary requests 1-6.\n\nIX. A communication from the Board, dated 2 July 2020, was sent to the parties. In this it was indicated in particular that the Board concurred with the conclusions of the opposition division with regard to inventive step.\n\nX. With a letter dated 24 February 2021, the appellant informed the Board and the parties that it will not take part in the oral proceedings scheduled for 4 March 2021 via videoconference.\n\nXI. With a letter in reply thereto and also dated 24 February 2021, the respondent requested that the oral proceedings be cancelled and the appeal be continued in writing. The Board cancelled the oral proceedings.\n\nXII. The arguments of the appellant may be summarised as follows:\n\nMain request - Inventive step\n\nD7 was the closest prior art, and disclosed in example 1 a water-free deodorant antiperspirant stick comprising\n\na) 5 to 30% by weight of an astringent antiperspirant salt, namely 20% by weight of aluminum chlorohydrate,\n\nb) 40 to 80% by weight of a continuous liquid phase,\n\nc) which comprises at least one water-immiscible oil, namely 36% cyclomethicone, 3% octyldodecanol, 2% C12-15 alkyl benzoate and 16% PPG14 butyl ether, i.e. a total of at least 57% oil phase,\n\nd) 5 to 30% by weight of a gelling agent for the carrier liquid,\n\ne) which is selected from fatty alcohol waxes, namely 18% stearyl alcohol.\n\nIn contrast to claim 1 of the patent in suit, the stick preparation according to D7 did not contain at least 0.25% by weight of mica pigment that was dispersed in the continuous liquid phase. Another difference to claim 1 of the patent in suit was that the stick preparation according to D7 did not contain 0.1% by weight of at least one aliphatic bivalent or trivalent humectant with a molecular weight of not more than 620 and/or at least 0.1% by weight of a triglyceride.\n\nThe objective problem was to provide an alternative antiperspirant that enabled an improved appearance.\n\nD7 suggested in paragraph [0066] to add pigments to the preparations. The person skilled in the art also knew mica pigments from D6, which were to be used in antiperspirant preparations (claim 7) in order to improve the appearance.\n\nNo effect was linked with the presence of the aliphatic bivalent or trivalent humectant. The only substances that showed an acceptable range of variation in the comparative tests of paragraph [0089] were the interference pigments used. Interference pigments, however, were pigments whose task in cosmetic preparations was known to be to conceal irregularities on the skin surface. This effect was based on the fact that light incident on the skin was reflected back diffusely, whereby color effects could also be used. The interference pigments only did what was expected of them. An inventive effect could not be recognized.\n\nThe preparation according to claim 1 was therefore not inventive.\n\nXIII. The arguments of the respondents may be summarised as follows\n\nMain request - Inventive step\n\nD7 was considered to constitute the most promising starting point in assessing inventive step as it taught antiperspirant compositions that included fatty alcohol as a gellant. Claim 1 of the patent maintained as amended differed from D7 in that it required the presence of at least 0.25% by weight of a mica pigment. This had the effect of improving skin appearance, especially in relation to skin tone, radiance and smoothness. This effect could be seen from the table on pages 12-13 of the patent, where an example according to the invention (Ex. 4, including mica pigments) had improved skin tone, radiance and smoothness in comparison to example CA, an identical formulation without mica.\n\nThe objective technical problem was therefore how to improve skin appearance, especially in relation to skin tone, radiance and smoothness of skin treated with a fatty alcohol gelled antiperspirant.\n\nD7 disclosed antiperspirants that included stearyl alcohol as a gellant, but did not relate to improving the skin appearance of skin treated with a fatty alcohol gelled antiperspirant composition, and it related to the general purpose of an aesthetically acceptable antiperspirant. Therefore, a skilled person starting from D7 and desiring to improve skin appearance of skin treated with a fatty alcohol gelled antiperspirant had no incentives from D7 to incorporate mica pigments into antiperspirant compositions to arrive at the present invention.\n\nD6 could not provide a solution to the problem, since it did not teach to use mica pigments to improve skin appearance of skin treated with a fatty alcohol gelled antiperspirant.\n\nTherefore, the subject matter of claim 1 involved an inventive step.\n\nXIV. Requests\n\nThe appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be revoked.\n\nThe respondents requested that the appeal be dismissed, alternatively that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be maintained according to the sets of claims filed as auxiliary requests 1-6 with letter of 12 June 2020.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. Main request - Inventive step\n\n1.1 The invention relates to an antiperspirant composition gelled by a fatty alcohol wax providing an improved skin appearance (see par. [0001] and [0007] of the specification).\n\n1.2 According to the appellant, the closest prior art is document D7. Example 1 of D7 discloses a composition comprising inter alia:\n\n- 20 wt% of aluminium chlorohydrate as antiperspirant\n\n- about 57 wt% of an oil phase consisting of 16 wt% of PPG-14 butylether, 3 wt% of octyldodecanol, 2 wt% of C12-C15 alkyl benzoate and 36 wt% of cyclomethicone\n\n- 18 wt% of stearyl alcohol which is a gelling agent.\n\nSaid example 1 does not comprise at least 0.1 % by weight of at least one aliphatic dihydric or trihydric moisturiser having a molecular weight of not greater than 620 and/or at least 0.1 % by weight of a triglyceride oil, as well as at least 0.25 % by weight of a mica pigment dispersed within the continuous lipid phase.\n\n1.3 According to the appellant, the problem must be seen as the provision of an alternative antiperspirant composition enabling an improved appearance.\n\nAccording to the respondent, the technical problem is how to improve skin appearance, especially in relation to skin tone, radiance and smoothness of skin treated with a fatty alcohol gelled antiperspirant.\n\n1.4 As a solution to any of these alleged problems, claim 1 of the main request proposes a formulation comprising in particular\n\n- at least 0.1 % by weight of at least one aliphatic dihydric or trihydric moisturiser having a molecular weight of not greater than 620 and/or at least 0.1 % by weight of a triglyceride oil, and\n\n- at least 0.25 % by weight of a mica pigment dispersed within the continuous lipid phase.\n\n1.5 The description of the contested patent provides several comparisons between a comparative composition CA and compositions according to the claimed invention.\n\n1.5.1 Example CA in the patent comprises inter alia:\n\n- 20 wt.% antiperspirant salt\n\n- 53.8 wt.% oils (28.3 wt.% cyclomethicone, 9 wt.% PPG-14 butyl ether, 15 wt.% C12-C15 alkylbenzoate, 1 wt.% dimethicone, and 0.5 wt.% helianthus annuus seed oil),\n\n- 17 wt.% stearyl alcohol\n\n1.5.2 Example 4 of the contested patent comprises inter alia:\n\n- 20 wt.% antiperspirant salt\n\n- 52.3 wt.% oils (26.8 wt.% cyclomethicone, 9 wt.% PPG-14 butyl ether, 15 wt.% C12-C15 alkylbenzoate, 1 wt.% dimethicone, and 0.5 wt.% helianthus annuus seed oil),\n\n- 17 wt.% stearyl alcohol compostion\n\n- 1.5 wt.% of mica pigment (0.25 wt.% mica, titanium dioxide, tin oxide and 1.25 wt.% of mica, titanium dioxide).\n\n1.5.3 Both examples have therefore a composition very close to the composition of example 1 of D7, and example 4 differs from the comparative example CA only in the presence of a mica pigment, and in the amounts of cyclomethicone. As explained by the respondent in its reply (page 2, lines 7-8) the additional amount of cyclomethicone in example CA (1.5%), was added to balance the weight of the ingredients. The Board sees no reason to consider that this negligible amount of cyclomethicone makes questionable the comparison of the two examples. Indeed, the appellant did not submit any argument in this sense.\n\nThe presence of a mica pigment in example 4 has the effect of improving skin appearance, especially in relation to skin tone, radiance and smoothness, as shown very explicitly in the Table of pages 12 and 13 of the contested patent.\n\n1.5.4 In view of these results, there is a clear evidence of a technical effect linked with the presence of a mica pigment and the problem is as defined by the respondent. This appears also to concur with the definition of the problem by the opposition division in its decision, namely the improvement of the visual appearance of skin treated with a fatty alcohol gelled antiperspirant composition.\n\n1.6 The question remaining is whether the skilled person, starting from example 1 of D7, would arrive at the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request in an obvious manner in order to solve the problem posed.\n\n1.6.1 The appellant mentioned documents D7 and D6 in this regard. According to the appellant, the addition of a pigment is suggested in D7 in paragraph [0066], and also in claim 7 of document D6.\n\n1.6.2 D7 mentions in paragraph [0066] a list of possible optional types of excipient which can be used in the compositions disclosed in D7; the addition of \"pigments that have a coloring effect\" is suggested in said paragraph. The type of pigment is however unspecified, and there is no indication that its use as disclosed relates to the technical effect of an improvement in tone, radiance and smoothness of axillary skin.\n\n1.6.3 D6 relates to the production of mixtures of interference pigments having novel color effects; hence, the aim of D6 is to achieve multi-color effects which is different from the aimed effect of the patent in suit . As explained by the opposition division in paragraph 2.3.5 of its decision, according to the teaching of D6, by adjusting the particle size of different colored interference pigments unusual color effects are obtained (par.[007]-[0010]). Among the suitable base substrates for the interference pigments natural and/or synthetic mica is mentioned ([0011]). D6 also mentions that the interference pigments mixtures can be used in antiperspirant formulations ([0042], claim 7). Specific examples of antiperspirant compositions containing mica pigments are however not provided by D6. Thus, this document does clearly not teach to use mica pigments to improve appearance of skin treated with antiperspirant compositions in general let alone those containing fatty alcohols gellants.\n\n1.6.4 Consequently, there is no suggestion or incentive in any of documents D6 or D7 for the addition of a mica pigment to improve skin appearance, especially in relation to skin tone, radiance and visual smoothness of skin treated with a fatty alcohol gelled antiperspirant.\n\nIt might be true that interference pigments, as argued by the appellant, including mica pigments, due to their optical properties, improve the skin appearance in general, but there is no evidence on file in this respect, and the appellant did not provide any.\n\nMoreover, as already stated by the opposition division in its decision, the objective technical problem does not relate to improving the appearance of skin treated with any cosmetic composition but to skin treated with an antiperspirant composition gelled with fatty alcohols. None of the cited documents contain a general teaching that by incorporating mica pigments in antiperspirant compositions the specific problems related to the skin appearance of the underarm skin would be ameliorated and this irrespective of the chemical composition of this type of formulations. Hence, these documents do not provide the necessary incentive for the skilled person searching to improve the appearance of a skin treated with a fatty alcohol gelled antiperspirant composition to use mica pigments.\n\n1.7 Consequently, the claimed subject-matter is inventive, and the main request meets the requirements of Article 56 EPC.",

November 2018 im Rahmen des Einspruchsverfahrens|\n\nIV. In der angefochtenen Entscheidung kam die Einspruchsabteilung zu dem Schluss, dass die in Anspruch 1 des Patents in der erteilten Fassung definierten Haut- und Handreinigungsmittel ausgehend von D3 als nächstem Stand der Technik nicht auf erfinderischer Tätigkeit beruhten. Insbesondere seien ausgehend von D3 keine auf das unterscheidende Merkmal, dem Zusatz des hydrophilen Polyolesters als Emollient (Merkmal a) des Anspruchs), zurückzuführenden Verbesserungen belegt. Die in D7-D9 vorgelegten Testresultate belegten eine solche Verbesserung nicht. Einer der im Patent verwendeten Polyolester sei in D5 als in Hautreinigungsmitteln zu verwendende rückfettende und hautfreundliche Substanz offenbart. Die beanspruchten Hautreinigungsmittel seien daher der Fachperson aus dem Stand der Technik nahegelegt, Artikel 56 EPÜ. Gleiches gelte für die Hilfsanträge.\n\nV. In ihrer Beschwerdebegründung und im weiteren Verfahren wandte sich die Beschwerdeführerin gegen diese Einschätzung und argumentierte im wesentlichen wie folgt:\n\nD7-D9 belegten durchaus verbesserte Eigenschaften der beanspruchten Zusammensetzungen in Bezug auf Reinigungswirkung und Hautfreundlichkeit gegenüber denjenigen der D3. Zwar liege kein direkter Vergleich vor, jedoch könnte aus den in D7-D9 erhaltenen Ergebnissen durch Extrapolation auf solche Verbesserungen geschlossen werden.\n\nGemäß D3 werde ein hoher Anteil an pflanzlichen Ölen verwendet, um die Hautfreundlichkeit der Reinigungsmittel sicherzustellen. Eine Fachperson habe keinen Anlass gehabt nach anderen Emollients Ausschau zu halten, der Einsatz der in D5 beschriebenen Produkte sei nicht nahegelegt. Erfinderische Tätigkeit sei daher auch dann gegeben, falls eine Verbesserung gegenüber D3 im direkten Vergleich nicht anerkannt werden könne.\n\nVI. In ihrer Beschwerdeerwiderung und im weiteren Verfahren verteidigte die Beschwerdegegnerin die Entscheidung der Einspruchsabteilung. Gegenüber D3 als nächstem Stand der Technik seien keine Verbesserungen gezeigt worden. Die zu lösende technische Aufgabe habe daher nur darin bestanden, zu D3 alternative Grobhandreinigungsmittel zur Verfügung zu stehen. Der Zusatz der in D5 offenbarten Polyolester sei nicht erfinderisch, da diese dort genau für den verwendeten Zweck, nämlich als hautfreundliche Emollients, beschrieben seien. Es müsse auch beachtet werden, dass der Anspruch des Streitpatents die Anwesenheit pflanzlicher Öle nicht ausschließe. Es gehe daher nicht darum, diese Öle zu ersetzen, sondern ausschließlich um den Zusatz der in D5 beschriebenen Komponente. Zur weiteren Untermauerung des Einwands wurde das Dokument D11 eingereicht.\n\nVII. Am 29. April 2022 erging eine Ladung zur mündlichen Verhandlung für den 31. Januar 2023. Am 23. September 2022 erließ die Kammer einen verfahrensleitenden Bescheid unter Artikel 15(1) RPBA 2020. In diesem Bescheid wurde ausgeführt, dass das Dokument D11 vermutlich unter Artikel 12(2) und 12(6) RPBA 2020 nicht mehr ins Verfahren zugelassen würde. Erfinderische Tätigkeit ausgehend von D3 müsse in der Verhandlung diskutiert werden.\n\nVIII. Am 31. Januar 2023 fand die mündliche Verhandlung statt, in der alle Parteien abschließend über die Frage der erfinderischen Tätigkeit vortrugen.\n\nIX. Die Anträge der Parteien waren die folgenden:\n\nDie Beschwerdeführerin(Patentinhaberin) beantragte die Entscheidung der Einspruchsabteilung aufzuheben und das Patent in der erteilten Form aufrechtzuerhalten, hilfsweise in geänderter Form aufrechtzuerhalten gemäß Hilfsanträgen 1-3 eingereicht im Einspruchsverfahren, sowie die Nicht-Zulassung des Dokuments D11 ins Verfahren.\n\nDie Beschwerdegegnerin (Einsprechende) beantragte die Zurückweisung der Beschwerde.\n\nX. Am Ende der mündlichen Verhandlung wurde die Entscheidung verkündet.",
         "Entscheidungsgründe\n\n1. Die Beschwerde ist zulässig.\n\n2. Erfinderische Tätigkeit (Artikel 56 EPÜ)\n\n2.1 Das Patent beschäftigt sich mit Haut- und Handreinigungsmitteln, insbesondere zur Grobreinigung, die etwa im industriellen Bereich zur Entfernung hartnäckiger Verschmutzungen eingesetzt werden. Die Verwendung derartiger Grobreinigungsmittel führt bei häufiger Benutzung wegen der Zerstörung des Hydro-Lipid-Mantels der Haut zu deren Entfettung und Austrocknung. Allgemein ist es daher Ziel der Entwicklung derartiger Reinigungsmittel, bei Erhalt der Reinigungswirkung die genannte Austrocknungs- und Entfettungsproblematik zu minimieren. Dies ist in Absätzen [0001] bis [0004] des Patents ausgeführt.\n\n2.2 Nächster Stand der Technik\n\nNächster Stand der Technik ist unbestritten D3. D3 beschäftigt sich mit dem gleichen Problem wie das Streitpatent, nämlich der Austrocknungs- und Entfettungsproblematik beim häufigen Benutzen von Grobhandreinigern, siehe Seite 1 Zeilen 3-18 bzw. 35-38.\n\nD3 schlägt zur Lösung dieser Problematik vor, in die Reinigungsmittel 10-30 Gew. % eines oder mehrer pflanzlicher Öle einzubringen, und zwar im Überschuss zu bestimmten in der Zusammensetzung vorhandenen Tensiden, siehe Seite 1 Zeilen 41-57 bzw. Seite 1 Zeile 67 bis Seite 2 Zeile 2. Daten zur Hautverträglichkeitsprüfung derartiger Zusammensetzungen sind in Tabelle 1 aufgeführt und es wird angegeben, dass diese im Vergleich zu herkömmlichen Reinigungsmitteln ohne Zusatz der pflanzlichen Öle hautverträglicher sind.\n\n2.3 Unterscheidendes Merkmal\n\nDas unterscheidende Merkmal der anspruchsgemäßen Zusammensetzungen im Vergleich zu denen der D3 besteht in der Anwesenheit der Komponente (a), dem Anteil von mindestens 0,1 Gew.-% von wenigstens einem Polyolester als hydrophilem Emollient mit einem HLB-Wert von >=10.\n\nDies war zwischen den Parteien unstrittig. Insbesondere waren sich die Parteien auch einig, dass die in D3 verwendeten Pflanzenöle in Anspruch 1 des Patents nicht ausgeschlossen sind, da sie unter die anspruchsgemäße Komponente (h) fallen.\n\n2.4 Technischer Effekt des unterscheidenden Merkmals\n\nDie Parteien waren sich uneins, ob durch die Zugabe der Polyolester ein technischer Effekt erzielt wird. In der angefochtenen Entscheidung wurde diese Frage von der Einspruchsabteilung verneint.\n\n2.4.1 Die Beschwerdeführerin bringt vor, die als Dokumente D7-D9 im Verfahren befindlichen Vergleichsdaten zeigten eine Verbesserung sowohl in Bezug auf die Reinigungswirkung, als auch in Bezug auf die Hautfreundlichkeit beanspruchter Zusammensetzungen im Vergleich zu solchen aus D3.\n\nDem kann die Kammer nicht zustimmen. Die in D8 getesteten Zusammensetzungen C1 und C5 enthalten beide kein Pflanzenöl. Dort wird der Effekt eines Polyolesters auf die Reinigungswirkung untersucht. Allerdings wird der Polyolester zu einer Zusammensetzung gegeben, die weder in D3 offenbart ist, noch unter dessen Lehre fällt. Mit einer solchen Anordnung kann kein Effekt anspruchsgemäßer Zusammensetzungen gegenüber denen der D3 gezeigt werden. Zwar hat die Beschwerdeführerin argumentiert, die Ergebnisse der D8 könnten auf ölhaltige Zusammensetzungen extrapoliert werden, sie ist dafür aber jeden Beleg schuldig geblieben.\n\nDie Ergebnisse der D9 erlauben es ebenfalls nicht, eine Verbesserung der Hautfreundlichkeit anspruchsgemäßer Zusammensetzungen gegenüber denen der D3 nachzuweisen. Zwar wird hier als Referenzzusammensetzung T eine Zusammensetzung verwendet, die 20 Gew-% Rapsöl enthält. Die zum Vergleich gewählte erfindungsgemäße Zusammensetzung Tmod enthält einen Polyolester gemäß Merkmal (a), allerdings kein Rapsöl. Da, wie oben ausgeführt und unbestritten, das unterscheidende Merkmal aber nicht im Ersatz, sondern im Zusatz des Polyolesters besteht, kann eine solche Versuchsanordnung schon deshalb keine auf das unterscheidende Merkmal zurückzuführende Verbesserung nachweisen.\n\nDer Einspruchsabteilung ist daher im Ergebnis zuzustimmen, dass die behauptete verbesserte Reinigungswirkung bzw. die behauptete verbesserte Hautfreundlichkeit anspruchsgemäßer Zusammensetzungen im Vergleich zu denen der D3 nicht nachgewiesen ist.\n\n2.4.2 Dies bedeutet aber nicht, dass, wie von der Einspruchsabteilung angenommen, und von der Beschwerdegegnerin vorgebracht, mit der Zugabe des Polyolesters, wie in Merkmal (a) des Anspruchs definiert, überhaupt kein technischer Effekt verbunden wäre.\n\nSowohl aus den Daten des Patents selbst wie auch aus D8 und D9 geht nämlich hervor, dass anspruchsgemäße Zusammensetzungen, die einen Polyolester, aber keine Pflanzenöle enthalten, zumindest gleichwertige Eigenschaften in Bezug auf die Hautverträglichkeit zeigen. Derartige Zusammensetzungen sind etwa die im Patent untersuchte Zusammensetzung C und die in D7-D9 untersuchten Zusammensetzungen C1 oder Tmod.\n\nDie Zugabe der hydrophilen Polyolester gemäß Merkmal (a) von Anspruch 1 erlaubt es daher, auf die in D3 als essentiell bezeichneten Pflanzenöle zu verzichten.\n\nDieser Effekt ist im übrigen bereits im Patent sowohl im allgemeinen Teil der Beschreibung in Absatz [0035], als auch unter Bezugnahme auf die erzielten Ergebnisse in Absatz [0060] beschrieben. Dass der Verzicht auf den Einsatz größerer Anteile an hydrophoben Pflanzenölen vorteilhaft ist, liegt auf der Hand; schließlich konkurrieren die lipophilen Öle in der tensidhaltigen Reinigungslösung mit dem üblicherweise ebenfalls lipophilen Schmutz, der entfernt werden soll.\n\n2.5 Aufgabe und Lösung\n\nDaher kann ausgehend von D3 die objektive technische Aufgabe formuliert werden, Haut- und Handreinigungsmittel zur Verfügung zu stellen, die vergleichbare Reinigungswirkung und Hautfreundlichkeit auch ohne die Anwesenheit der in D3 verlangten Pflanzenöle erreichen.\n\nDies wird durch die beanspruchten Haut- und Handreinigungsmittel erreicht, die sich gegenüber D3 durch die Anwesenheit der in Merkmal (a) definierten Polyolester auszeichnen.\n\n2.6 Naheliegen der Lösung\n\n2.6.1 Aus dem Stand der Technik war es der Fachperson nicht nahegelegt, ausgehend von D3 Polyolester als Emollients zu verwenden, um auch ohne den Zusatz von 10-30 Gew.% Pflanzenölen eine zufriedenstellende Reinigungswirkung und Hautfreundlichkeit zu erreichen. Die Gründe hierfür sind im folgenden ausgeführt.\n\n2.6.2 Laut D3 ist die Anwesenheit von 10-30 Gew.% Pflanzenölen in einem bestimmten Verhältnis von Tensiden vonnöten, um eine zufriedenstellende Hautfreundlichkeit zu erreichen, siehe Seite 1 Zeilen 41-57 bzw. Seite 1 Zeile 67 bis Seite 2 Zeile 2. Das Vorhandensein weiterer, hydrophiler Emollients ist in D3 weder explizit erwähnt, noch angedeutet.\n\n2.6.3 Die Beschwerdegegnerin hat hier auf D5 verwiesen. D5 ist eine Produktbroschüre für TEGOSOFT**(®) PC31, einem hydrophilen Emollient, das unter Merkmal (a) des Anspruchs 1 fällt und auch in den Beispielformulierungen des Patents Verwendung findet. Insbesondere hat die Beschwerdegegnerin darauf hingewiesen, dass dieses Produkt als rückfettend und hautfreundlich beschrieben wird und daher genau die Eigenschaften habe, die ausgehend von D3 gesucht werden. Außerdem werde beschrieben, dass es in synergistischer Weise mit vorhandenen Verdickungsmitteln wechselwirkt. In Anbetracht des hohen Anteils an Verdickungsmitteln in D3, den die Fachperson zu verringern suche, sei dies ein weiterer Hinweis, dieses Produkt einzusetzen.\n\n2.6.4 Im Hinblick auf die zu lösende technische Aufgabe geht der Verweis auf D5 schon deshalb ins Leere, da die Fachperson D5 keine Information entnehmen kann, der Einsatz des dort beschriebenen Polyolesters würde die Anwesenheit weiterer Emollients, etwa der in D3 verwendeten Pflanzenöle, überflüssig machen.\n\nIm übrigen erwähnt D5 keine Grobreiniger. Des weiteren handelt es sich bei den in D5 gezeigten Anwendungsbeispielen um ein Duschgel (\"body wash\") oder um einen wässrigen Gesichtsreinigungsschaum. Dies entspricht nicht der in D3 beschriebenen Anwendung. Die Beispielformulierungen sind auch wässrig oder enthalten nur geringe Anteile an pflanzlichen Ölen. Eine Fachperson, die die Reinigungsmittel der D3 vor Augen hat, hätte daher ohnehin wenig Anlass gehabt, die in D5 beschriebenen Komponente den in D3 beschriebenen Grobreinigungsmitteln hinzuzufügen.\n\nDer Verweis auf die verdickenden Eigenschaften des Produkts in D5 ändert daran nichts. In D3 ist nicht beschrieben, dass der dort verwendete Anteil von 5% Verdickungsmitteln ungewöhnlich oder nachteilig ist. Eine Fachperson hätte ausgehend von D3 derartigen Eigenschaften keine besondere Bedeutung beigemessen.\n\n2.6.5 Die Beschwerdegegnerin hat unter Berufung auf die Entscheidungsbegründung der Einspruchsabteilung vorgebracht, eine Fachperson hätte keiner besonderen Motivation bedurft, den Zusammensetzungen der D3 kommerziell erhältliche kosmetische Zusatzstoffe, etwa die der D5, hinzuzufügen.\n\nDem ist allerdings entgegenzuhalten, dass es hier nicht darum geht, den Zusammensetzungen der D3 irgendwelche beliebige Komponenten, etwa Emollients hinzuzufügen, die an der Lehre der D3 nichts ändern. Die Auswahl gerade der in D5 beschriebenen Polyolester hat ja im Gegenteil zur Folge, dass auf die in D3 als essentiell beschriebenen pflanzlichen Öle verzichtet werden kann. Insofern führt die Auswahl der Polyole der D5 aus der Vielzahl der auf dem Markt befindlichen kosmetischen Zusatzstoffe dazu, dass die in D3 beschriebenen Einschränkungen überwunden werden können. Darauf gibt es weder in der D3 noch in der D5 einen Hinweis.\n\n2.7 Als grundsätzlichen Einwand hat die Beschwerdegegnerin vorgebracht, die Beurteilung der erfinderischen Tätigkeit in der oben durchgeführten Weise sei unzulässig. Anspruch 1 des Patents schließe ja die Anwesenheit der in D3 beschriebenen pflanzlichen Öle nicht aus. Die als erfinderischer Beitrag angesehene Möglichkeit, die Pflanzenöle wegzulassen, finde daher gar keine Entsprechung in technischen Merkmalen des Patentanspruchs.\n\nDie Kammer hält dieses Vorbringen nicht für überzeugend.\n\nDie Möglichkeit, entgegen der Lehre der D3 die Pflanzenöle weglassen zu können, ist ein Ergebnis der Anwesenheit der Komponente (a). Im Rahmen des Aufgabe-Lösungsansatzes ist bei Produktansprüchen das zu erzielende Ergebnis Bestandteil der Aufgabenstellung und muss daher nicht im Anspruch konkretisiert werden. Ansonsten würde die Aufgabenstellung schließlich Elemente der beanspruchten Lösung vorwegnehmen, siehe Rechtsprechung, 10te Auflage 2022, I.D.4.2.\n\nDas erfindungswesentliche Merkmal ausgehend von D3 ist die Anwesenheit der Polyolester (a). Dieses Merkmal ermöglicht in überraschender Weise, sich über die Lehre der D3 hinwegzusetzen, wie in Absatz [0035] des Patents beschrieben. Eine weitere Einschränkung des Anspruchs ist nicht erforderlich.\n\n2.8 D11\n\nIn ihrer Beschwerdeerwiderung die Beschwerdegegnerin das Dokument D11 eingereicht und sich bei ihrer Argumentation bezüglich erfinderischer Tätigkeit darauf bezogen. Die Kammer hat in ihrer vorläufigen Meinung in ihrer Mitteilung unter Artikel 15(1) VOBK 2020 zu erkennen gegeben, dass eine Zulassung dieses Dokuments ins Beschwerdeverfahren unter unter Artikel 12(2) und 12(6) RPBA 2020 unwahrscheinlich sei. In der mündlichen Verhandlung hat sich die Beschwerdegegnerin auf dieses Dokument nicht mehr berufen. Eine Entscheidung über dessen Nichtzulassung, wir von der Beschwerdeführerin beantragt, erübrigt sich daher.\n\n2.9 Zusammenfassend kommt die Kammer zu dem Ergebnis, dass die im unabhängigen Anspruch 1 des erteilten Patents definierten Zusammensetzung auf erfinderischer Tätigkeit beruhen. Die Hilfsanträge der Beschwerdeführerin können unbeachtet bleiben.\n\n3. Da kein vorgebrachter Einspruchsgrund der Aufrechterhaltung des Patents entgegensteht, kann gemäß Artikel 103(2) EPÜ der Einspruch zurückgewiesen werden. Das Patent hat in der erteilten Form Bestand.\n\n4.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. European patent No. 2 040 672 is based on European patent application No. 07836046.8, filed as an international application published as WO2008/008364.\n\nII. The following documents, cited during the opposition and appeal proceedings, are referred to below:\n\n(2) J. March, \"Advanced Organic Chemistry\", 4th edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1992, 896 to 898\n\n(3) Chafetz et al., Pharm. Res., 1987, 4(2), 158 to 161\n\n(4) Internet publication: \"Croda presents new high purity excipients\", In-PharmaTechnologist, 2005, 1 page\n\n(8) WO03/011306\n\n(13) Affidavit of Dr William Bubnis, 3 August 2016, 4 pages\n\n(13a) Exhibit WB1 accompanying the affidavit of Dr Bubnis (document (13)), 11 pages\n\nIII. The European patent was opposed under Article 100(a), (b) and (c) EPC on the grounds that the claimed subject-matter lacked inventive step, was not disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art, and extended beyond the content of the application as filed.\n\nClaim 1 of the patent in suit reads as follows:\n\n\"1. An oral liquid pharmaceutical composition comprising:\n\n(a) phenylephrine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and\n\n(b) substantially aldehyde-free polyethylene glycol, wherein the substantially aldehyde-free polyethylene glycol has less than 10 ppm total aldehyde content and maintains said level of aldehyde content for at least six months; wherein the composition is buffered to maintain the pH below 5.4.\"\n\nIV. The opposition division rejected the opposition. The opponent (appellant) appealed this decision. The appellant's sole objection was lack of inventive step.\n\nV. With the agreement of all parties, oral proceedings by video conference were held on 3 September 2020.\n\nVI. The appellant's arguments, in so far as they are relevant to the present decision, may be summarised as follows.\n\nDocument (8) exemplified a composition comprising pseudoephedrine and polyethylene glycol. According to claim 7 of this document, the pseudoephedrine could be replaced by phenylephrine. Having made the change from pseudoephedrine to phenylephrine, the skilled person would have assessed the stability of the composition in a systematic way using standard analytical techniques. Such techniques included the generation of spectroscopic data. The skilled person, routinely performing a methodical series of experiments, would have seen from the spectroscopic data that the phenylephrine degradants were products of a reaction with aldehydes. It was common general knowledge that aldehydes, including formaldehyde and aldehydes with more carbon atoms, reacted with amines (see document (2)). Furthermore, such a reaction was even disclosed for phenylephrine in document (3). Document (4) provided the general teaching that purer grade polyethylene glycols could improve the stability of pharmaceutically active ingredients and that such polyethylene glycols would have lower levels of aldehydes. The skilled person was thus in a normal \"try and see\" situation and faced no technically challenging hurdles when carrying out their routine approach. Consequently, they would have identified the grade of polyethylene glycol, especially the content of aldehydes, as a potential problem for phenylephrine stability.\n\nIn sum, the steps taken by the patent proprietor in developing the claimed formulation represented nothing more than obvious/non-inventive steps which would have been readily contemplated by the person skilled in the art, as was apparent from document (13a).\n\nFurthermore, the problem of providing a stable and thus commercially acceptable composition had not been solved by the claims under consideration. Document (13a) established that high fructose corn syrup had a much higher impact on the stability of phenylephrine than the grade of polyethylene glycol. However, the claims allowed for the presence of high fructose corn syrup.\n\nVII. The respondent's (patent proprietor's) arguments, in so far as they are relevant to the present decision, may be summarised as follows.\n\nStarting from document (8) there were two differences: the active agent and the use of a polyethylene glycol with a low aldehyde content. The replacement of pseudoephedrine by phenylephrine was pushed for by regulatory requirements. Example 5 and Figure 1 of the patent in suit showed that the use of a polyethylene glycol having a very low aldehyde content improved the stability of phenylephrine. The technical problem was thus as described in paragraph [0004] of the patent in suit. The mere mention in the patent in suit that pharmaceutical formulations needed to be commercially acceptable did not lead to an obligation to formulate the problem in such a broad way. Stability effects caused by high fructose corn syrup were not linked to effects due to the use of low aldehyde content polyethylene glycol.\n\nIt was common general knowledge that aldehydes reacted with amines. However, both compounds disclosed in document (8), phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine, had almost identical side chains, both of which contained an amine group. The skilled person would thus not have expected that aldehydes were the main source of the different stabilities.\n\nDocument (3) related to very specific reactions. In particular, the high amounts of formaldehyde used in the reactions would have prevented the skilled person from considering this document when trying to identify potentially problematic impurities.\n\nDocument (4) was general and did not mention phenylephrine. Furthermore, it had been shown in document (13a) that Croda's Super Refined PEG, as disclosed in document (4), was inadequate.\n\nDocument (8) was silent on stability issues when changing the active agent. It was unclear which agent or ingredient caused the instability of the phenylephrine and where the cause of the instability came from. The skilled person was thus not prompted to consider total aldehydes. Phenylephrine could undergo many different reactions that would not necessarily be identified, for instance from spectroscopic data, as stemming from a reaction with aldehydes.\n\nSince neither the impurity causing the degradation of phenylephrine nor the source of this impurity was known to the skilled person, they would not have arrived in an obvious way at the claimed subject-matter. An inventive step was thus present.\n\nVIII. The final requests were as follows.\n\nThe appellant (opponent) requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that European patent No. 2 040 672 be revoked.\n\nThe respondent (patent proprietor) requested that the appeal be dismissed, or, alternatively, that the patent be maintained on the basis of any of auxiliary requests 1 to 4 submitted with the reply to the grounds of appeal.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeal is admissible.\n\n2. Inventive step\n\n2.1 The patent in suit relates to oral liquid pharmaceutical compositions comprising phenylephrine. A palatable liquid dosage form comprising phenylephrine with reduced propensity for degradation of phenylephrine is to be provided (paragraphs [0001] and [0004]). To this end, a composition comprising phenylephrine and substantially aldehyde-free polyethylene glycol is taught (paragraph [0005]). The patent puts forward that phenylephrine degradation is facilitated by the presence of aldehydes and reducing sugars (paragraph [0011]).\n\n2.2 The decision under appeal relies on document (8) as the closest prior art. This has not been contested by the appellant.\n\nDocument (8) discloses several compositions having the required pH and comprising pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and Polyethylene Glycol 1450 (Examples 1-3 and 5). It furthermore defines compositions having a pH of 2.0 to 5.0 and comprising sucralose and at least one active (claim 1). Phenylephrine may be selected as the active (claim 7).\n\n2.3 When starting from one of Examples 1-3 and 5 of document (8), the difference between claim 1 of the patent in suit and the closest prior art is the active agent and the use of polyethylene glycol having a low aldehyde content as excipient.\n\nIt was common ground that the replacement of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride by phenylephrine (or a salt thereof) was prompted by regulatory changes and did not involve an inventive step.\n\nThe focus of the present decision is thus on the difference in excipients, in particular in the selection of a polyethylene glycol having less than 10 ppm total aldehyde content.\n\nThe effect linked to this difference is an increased stability of phenylephrine (see Figure 1 of the patent in suit).\n\nThe appellant has argued that excipients other than polyethylene glycol have a much higher impact on the stability of the composition, and has referred explicitly to high fructose corn syrup.\n\nHowever, the influence of high fructose corn syrup on the degradation of phenylephrine has not been shown to influence the effects of low aldehyde content polyethylene glycol on the degradation of phenylephrine. The effects of low aldehyde content and presence of high fructose corn syrup thus have to be considered independently. Consequently, the effect of the low aldehyde content of the polyethylene glycol excipient is to be taken into account over the whole scope of claim 1 of the patent as granted.\n\n2.4 The problem to be solved may therefore be formulated as the provision of a palatable liquid dosage form comprising phenylephrine with reduced propensity for degradation of phenylephrine, as is disclosed in the patent in suit, paragraph [0004].\n\nAs can be seen from the discussion above, the problem has been solved.\n\n2.5 It remains to determine whether it would have been obvious to the skilled person to use polyethylene glycols having very low total aldehyde contents as excipients for phenylephrine.\n\nDocument (8) does not discuss the influence of the excipients used in its examples on the stability of the pharmaceutical actives. Thus, document (8) itself does not provide any guidance to the skilled person on stability issues when changing the active agent from pseudoephedrine to phenylephrine.\n\nIt is common ground that a skilled person, faced with a composition in which the pharmaceutically active ingredient shows degradation, would have undertaken steps towards a stable composition. These steps include analytical research, which would probably generate spectroscopic data. However, in the present case, no spectra of any kind have been submitted by the appellant. The respondent has argued that it might not be easily derivable from spectroscopic data that the degradation products resulted from a reaction of phenylephrine with an aldehyde. In the absence of any such data, the board is in no position to come to a finding on whether the skilled person would have realised that the degradation products resulted from a reaction with aldehydes. Thus, it has not been established that the skilled person would have been led directly to consider aldehydes and would have looked for an aldehyde source. Consequently, the present case does not represent a \"try and see\" situation.\n\nWhen starting from document (8), and in particular when starting from one of the examples comprising pseudoephedrine as pharmaceutically active agent, the skilled person would have based their consideration on the differences and similarities to the compounds present in these examples. The respondent has pointed to the chemical structures of pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine (see structures depicted in the reply to the grounds of appeal, page 5). In these structures the amine group, which can possibly react with an aldehyde, is present in the side chain. The respondent has stressed that the side chains of the two compounds merely differed in the presence of a methyl group. The appellant has not commented on a possible change in reactivity of the amine group due to the vicinity of this methyl substituent. It is thus unclear whether the skilled person would have expected the amine group of phenylephrine to be more reactive, or put differently, more prone to degradation reactions, than the amine group of pseudoephedrine. Therefore, the skilled person is not led to consider impurities capable of reacting with an amine group such as aldehydes.\n\nThe appellant has further pointed to document (3), which teaches that phenylephrine reacts with formaldehyde. However, the reaction conditions in document (3) do not resemble the conditions in a pharmaceutical composition where the active agent is present in considerable excess over any impurities and where any impurities, whether their presence is known or unknown (as in the present case where it has not been established that the skilled person would have known that aldehydes were responsible for the degradation of phenylephrine), are usually present in very low concentrations. Thus, when starting from document (8) as the closest prior art, and especially starting from an example having a structurally related, pharmaceutically active agent, the skilled person would not have considered this document to be pertinent. The same applies to document (2), which represents the common general knowledge on reactions of amines with aldehydes.\n\nDocument (4) cannot lead the skilled person to the subject-matter of claim 1 of the patent in suit either. Document (4) relates to super refined PEG and super refined oleic acid as excipients \"claimed to enhance active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and formulation stability\" (page 1, paragraph 1). It discloses the removal of several polar impurities, including aldehydes. It is thus a document that would have been considered by the skilled person faced with a formulation in which the pharmaceutically active ingredient shows degradation. However, as can be seen from document (13a) (see page 6, paragraph 2 of section 5.14.8), the removal of polar impurities, including aldehydes, according to document (4) does not result in a total aldehyde content of less than 10 ppm. In fact, total aldehyde contents ranging from 38 to 490 ppm were found for the \"\"super refined\" Croda 400 PEGs\". The skilled person, not being focused on aldehydes, would not have considered lowering the aldehyde content further, in general or in particular, in the polyethylene glycol disclosed in document (4).\n\nIn sum, when starting from document (8), the skilled person would not have automatically identified aldehydes as the cause of the degradation of phenylephrine and, consequently, would not have sought to use polyethylene glycol having a very low content of total aldehydes as excipient.\n\n2.6 The subject-matter of the claims of the patent as granted involves an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).\n\n2.7 In the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, the appellant has not specifically contested any other points of the decision under appeal. Nor has it raised any further specific objections in the course of these appeal proceedings.

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. This decision concerns the appeal filed by the opponent (appellant) against the opposition division's decision (decision under appeal) to reject the opposition against European patent No. 3 045 466 (patent).\n\nII. Before the opposition division, the appellant had requested revocation of the patent in its entirety, relying on the grounds for opposition under Article 100(a) EPC (lack of inventive step) and Article 100(b) EPC. On appeal, the appellant only invoked the former ground.\n\nIII. The following documents, filed before the opposition division, are relevant for the present decision:\n\nD1      WO 2004/063209 A2\n\nD4      WO 2004/060347 A2\n\nD12     Declaration of Li Tao (5 pages)\n\nIV. With the reply to the statement of grounds of appeal, the patent proprietor (respondent) continued to pursue the granted patent as the main request. It also filed, inter alia, the sets of claims of auxiliary request 1 and the following documents:\n\nD13    A. Braem et al., Top. Med. Chem., 12, 2014,\n\n73-94\n\nD14    D. Brage et al., Chem. Comm., 2005, 3635-3645\n\nV. The oral proceedings before the board took place as a videoconference on 19 January 2023 in the presence of both parties. The respondent made auxiliary request 1, filed with the reply to the statement of grounds of appeal, its main request. At the end of the oral proceedings, the chair announced the order of the present decision.\n\nVI. Summaries of the appellant's arguments are contained in the reasons for the decision.\n\nVII. The respondent's arguments relevant to the present decision can be summarised as follows.\n\nD1 was the closest prior art. Amorphous dapagliflozin, as disclosed in example 20 of D1, was a suitable starting point for the assessment of inventive step. The fact that a moisture adsorption/desorption isotherm was shown in D12 for form SC-3 but not for amorphous dapagliflozin did not prevent a proper comparison of both forms. The appellant's argument that the amorphous forms of D1 and D12 were different was merely an allegation. Thus, it had to be concluded from D12 that form SC-3 referred to in claim 1 of the main request was more stable, i.e. less hygroscopic, than amorphous dapagliflozin. This effect was achieved over the entire breadth of claim 1 because, first, the appellant had provided no evidence to support its contention that claim 1 encompassed more crystalline forms than used in D12 and, second, because the higher stability of form SC-3 was also achieved when it was contained in a composition as shown by D13. Hence, the objective technical problem was to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a crystalline form of dapagliflozin which was more stable, i.e. less hygroscopic. The teaching of D4 was so broad and so general that the skilled person would not have considered it to be as generally applicable as suggested. This was because the formation of crystalline forms and their properties were highly unpredictable. Furthermore, a comparison of examples 1 and 7 of D4 strongly indicated that a reduced hygroscopicity was in fact not achieved.\n\nThe crystalline complex of dapagliflozin/L-phenylalanine was not disclosed in an enabling manner in example 13 of D1. Even if it had been disclosed in an enabling manner, the skilled person would not have started from this complex when attempting to prepare a PG solvate of dapagliflozin according to the teaching of D4. The combination with D4 was based on hindsight. To obtain the solvate of claim 1, the skilled person would have had to resort to amorphous dapagliflozin over which an inventive step was to be acknowledged.\n\nThus, the subject-matter of claim 1, and by the same token of its dependent claims, involved an inventive step.\n\nVIII. The parties' final requests relevant for the present decision were as follows.\n\nThe appellant requested that the patent be revoked in its entirety and that D14 not be admitted into the proceedings.\n\nThe respondent requested that the patent be maintained in amended form based on the set of claims of the main request, filed as auxiliary request 1 with the reply to the statement of grounds of appeal.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\nAdmittance of D14\n\n1. D14 was filed by the respondent with the reply to the statement of grounds of appeal as evidence of common general knowledge. D14 showed that the formation of crystalline forms and their properties were highly unpredictable.\n\nAt the oral proceedings before the board, the appellant did in fact accept as common general knowledge what D14 was submitted as evidence for. Nevertheless, it maintained its request not to admit D14 into the proceedings because it could not be ruled out that the appellant also relied on other aspects of D14.\n\nSince the appellant did not rely on such other aspects, it was not necessary to decide on the admittance of D14.\n\nMain request - Inventive step - Article 56 EPC\n\n2. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:\n\n\"A pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and a crystalline structure of a compound of formula I\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nin the form of its propylene glycol solvate for use in treating a disorder selected from diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy, delayed wound healing, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, elevated blood levels of fatty acids or glycerol, hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, Syndrome X, diabetic complications, atherosclerosis or hypertension, or for use in increasing high density lipoprotein levels in a mammal,\n\nwherein the crystalline structure is an  (S)-propylene glycol ((S)-PG) solvate of the structure (form SC-3) Ia\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\"\n\nThe compound of formula I above, 1-C-(6-chloro-4'-ethoxydiphenylmethane-3-yl)-beta-D-glucopyranose, is commonly known as dapagliflozin. Thus, claim 1 is directed to second medical uses of a crystalline solvate of dapagliflozin with water and (S)-propylene glycol which comprises these three constituents in equimolar amounts (1:1:1 molar ratio). In accordance with claim 1, this crystalline solvate is referred to as form SC-3 below. Furthermore, the following abbreviations are used:\n\nPG    for     propylene glycol\n\nAPI   for     active pharmaceutical ingredient\n\n3. D1 (page 1, lines 5 to 13 and page 35, lines 13 to 20) relates to a process of producing 1-C-(substituted diphenylmethane-3-yl)-beta-D-glucopyranose compounds, such as dapagliflozin in particular. It also pertains to crystalline complexes of these C-aryl glucoside compounds formed with an amino acid complex forming agent such as L-phenylalanine. The 1-C-(substituted diphenylmethane-3-yl)-beta-D-glucopyranose compounds of D1 are stated to be useful in the treatment of diabetes (page 20, lines 10 to 26), i.e. one of the conditions mentioned in claim 1 of the main request.\n\nAgainst this background, it was common ground between the parties that D1 constitutes the closest prior art. The board saw no reason to deviate from this unanimous view.\n\n4. D1 describes the stepwise synthesis of dapagliflozin. In the last step of the synthesis, dapagliflozin is obtained \"as a glassy off white solid\" (example 20). It was common ground between the parties that this should be understood as a reference to amorphous dapagliflozin.\n\nFurthermore, according to the appellant, D1 disclosed the preparation of a crystalline complex of dapagliflozin with L-phenylalanine (example 13). The parties disagreed on whether this disclosure was enabling. In the following, it is accepted in the appellant's favour that example 13 of D1 does in fact disclose a crystalline complex of dapagliflozin with L-phenylalanine in an enabling manner.\n\n5. The appellant put forward inventive-step objections starting from both forms of dapagliflozin disclosed in D1, i.e. amorphous dapagliflozin and the crystalline complex of dapagliflozin with L-phenylalanine. Both of the appellant's objections are assessed in the following.\n\nAmorphous dapagliflozin as the starting point\n\n6. It was common ground between the parties that the subject-matter of claim 1 differs from amorphous dapagliflozin in that, inter alia, dapagliflozin is present as form SC-3, i.e. a crystalline solvate of dapagliflozin with water and (S)-PG comprising these three compounds in equimolar amounts (1:1:1 molar ratio) instead of its amorphous form.\n\n7. D12 is a summary of the respondent's efforts made in the course of developing a pharmaceutically acceptable form of dapagliflozin. Points 8 and 19 of this declaration relate to amorphous dapagliflozin and form SC-3 of claim 1, respectively. These points read as follows:\n\n\"8. [...] After the solvent(s) were removed from the gel, an amorphous glassy foam was generally formed. This amorphous glassy material was physically unstable. It transformed to a gel on exposure to relative humidities >33% at room temperature within a day, thereby posing significant handling issues.\"\n\n\"19. [...] SC-3 (dapagliflozin + 1 (S)-propylene glycol + 1 H2O) is physically stable under ambient temperature and humidity. Results from moisture sorption-desorption studies indicate that SC-3 is non-hygroscopic at 25 °C (Fig. 2).\"\n\nIn figure 2 under point 19, D12 also shows the moisture adsorption/desorption isotherm for form SC-3.\n\n8. The above two statements are clear, and nothing was apparent that could have called their accuracy into question. While it is true that D12 shows a moisture adsorption/desorption isotherm for form SC-3 but not for amorphous dapagliflozin, as argued by the appellant, both points 8 and 19 nevertheless allow a direct comparison to be made between both forms. It can be concluded that form SC-3 has a higher stability, i.e. a lower hygroscopicity, than amorphous dapagliflozin.\n\n9. The appellant did not agree with this conclusion. It argued that D12 could not show any effect relative to the amorphous dapagliflozin of D1. While both D1 and D12 referred to amorphous dapagliflozin, detailed instructions for its preparation were only disclosed in D1. Therefore, it was possible that both amorphous forms were in fact not the same. It was quite conceivable that dapagliflozin showed polyamorphism, i.e. that several amorphous forms existed. This was supported by the fact that D12 described the amorphous form as a \"glassy foam\", whereas D1 spoke of a \"glassy off white solid\" without mentioning a foamy appearance.\n\nHowever, amorphous dapagliflozin is obtained in D1 and D12 in essentially the same way, namely by removing the solvent from a solution of dapagliflozin. Although the solvent used is not specified in D12, this alone, at least in the absence of evidence to the contrary, does not support the allegation that the two amorphous forms of D1 and D12 could be different in any way. A supposedly different macroscopic appearance (\"solid\" vs \"foam\") does also not allow any conclusion to be drawn about the arrangement of the molecules in the solid form and thus whether the amorphous form used in D12 must necessarily be different from that disclosed in D1.\n\n10. Thus, in line with the respondent's position, the objective technical problem can be considered that of providing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a crystalline form of dapagliflozin which is more stable, i.e. less hygroscopic.\n\n11. The appellant disagreed with this objective technical problem. According to it, an effect, if any, could not be acknowledged over the entire breadth of claim 1 of the main request, and the objective technical problem had to be formulated less ambitiously, namely as that of providing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a crystalline form of dapagliflozin.\n\n11.1 The appellant argued that form SC-3 of D12 had a specific crystal structure. While claim 1 of the main request specified the molar ratios of dapagliflozin, (S)-PG and water, its subject-matter was not limited in terms of crystal structure. This meant that claim 1 actually encompassed further solid forms which had the same molar ratio but a different crystal structure from form SC-3 of D12. However, nothing had been shown in terms of hygroscopicity for such further solid forms.\n\nThe board agrees with the appellant that form SC-3 of D12 not only comprises the three constituents in a molar ratio of 1:1:1 but also has a specific crystal structure. However, the mere fact that the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request is limited only by the molar ratio of the constituents does not allow the conclusion that there must necessarily be other solid forms with the same molar ratio besides the form actually used in D12. The appellant, who bears the burden of proof, did not demonstrate that such a further solid form exists.\n\n11.2 The appellant further submitted that claim 1 of the main request related to a pharmaceutical composition. It could not simply be assumed that form SC-3 was more stable when contained in such a composition.\n\nHowever, the board fails to see why form SC-3 should not retain its higher stability in terms of a lower hygroscopicity compared to amorphous dapagliflozin in a pharmaceutical composition. From the fact that form SC-3 was chosen for the pharmaceutical development of the drug ultimately on the market (D13: page 88, last paragraph), precisely the opposite conclusion must be drawn.\n\n12. As regards obviousness, the appellant pointed to D4.\n\n12.1 D4 relates to PG solvates of APIs and states, quite generally, (on page 4, paragraph 4; page 3, paragraphs 2 and 3) that:\n\n(a) the formation of PG solvates makes it possible to obtain crystalline compounds from APIs which are difficult to crystallise\n\n(b) API PG solvates are more stable and less hygroscopic than the corresponding APIs\n\n12.2 The appellant argued that the skilled person would have turned to D4 because it offered solutions to the problem of providing a crystalline form of an API as well as to the problem of providing a form that is less hygroscopic. Consequently, the subject-matter of claim 1 did not involve an inventive step over a combination of D1 and D4.\n\n12.3 The appellant's argument that the skilled person would have consulted D4 when trying to solve the objective technical problem is not sufficient. For this argument to be correct, the skilled person, in order to take the teaching of D4 into account, would also have had to have a reasonable expectation of success, i.e. a reasonable expectation that this teaching would solve the objective technical problem. However, this is not the case, as set out in the following.\n\n12.4 On pages 45 to 296, D4 gives a very long list of APIs whose PG solvates are said to be covered by the invention in D4. Among these compounds is T-1095 (page 267, entry 4), i.e. a compound which is structurally similar to dapagliflozin. In view of points 12.1 (a) and (b) above, this list amounts to D4 pretending to have found an almost universal solution to the problem of providing a crystalline form of an API and in particular to the problem of providing a form of an API which is less hygroscopic. This alone would not have given the skilled person a reasonable expectation of success, i.e. a reasonable expectation of obtaining a crystalline form of the compound dapagliflozin which is less hygroscopic than amorphous dapagliflozin. The reason is that, as agreed by both parties at the oral proceedings, the formation of crystalline forms and their properties such as hygroscopicity is highly unpredictable. So while the board acknowledges that D4 demonstrates that four structurally very different and unrelated APIs can be transformed into crystalline PG solvates, D4 lacks experimental data showing that an API PG solvate is less hygroscopic than the API itself.\n\nFurthermore, the examples in D4 cast legitimate doubt on whether the effect of a lower hygroscopicity is actually achieved as universally as suggested. In example 1, celecoxib sodium PG solvate is prepared. Then in example 7, this PG solvate is allowed to bind water from the environment, eventually resulting in celecoxib sodium PG trihydrate (i.e. a mixed PG/water solvate of celecoxib sodium). This shows that celecoxib sodium PG solvate, i.e. a PG solvate according to the teaching of D4, is still hygroscopic.\n\nAccording to the appellant, this did not allow the conclusion to be drawn that a lower hygroscopicity would not have been achieved. To draw such a conclusion, celecoxib sodium PG solvate would have had to be compared with its reference compound celecoxib sodium (D4: page 14, last paragraph).\n\nThis argument fails to convince because D4 does in fact allow an indirect comparison between celecoxib sodium PG solvate and celecoxib sodium in terms of their hygroscopicity. D4 provides a classification scheme for the degree of hygroscopicity ranging from class 1 (non-hygroscopic) to class 4 (very hygroscopic). According to this classification scheme, compounds are very hygroscopic if they absorb moisture at relative humidities as low as 40 to 50% (D4: page 14, paragraph 2). Based on this scheme, celecoxib sodium PG solvate is very hygroscopic because it begins to absorb moisture even at relative humidities between 31 and 40% (D4: page 43, lines 6 to 7 below \"Example 7\"). With celecoxib sodium PG solvate belonging to the worst hygroscopicity class, its hygroscopicity cannot be lower than that of its reference compound, celecoxib sodium, at least when judged according to D4's own classification scheme.\n\nBased on the above, the skilled person would have considered the effect suggested by D4, namely the universal decrease in hygroscopicity, to be a mere allegation. Given the generally recognised high unpredictability of properties of crystalline forms (see above), the skilled person would not have had a reasonable expectation of obtaining a less hygroscopic form of dapagliflozin.\n\n13. In view of the foregoing, the current case is also different from the case underlying decision T 777/08, on which the appellant relied.\n\n13.1 In that decision, as in the current case, the starting point for the assessment of inventive step was the amorphous form of an API. The objective technical problem was considered that of providing a form having improved filterability and drying characteristics. The deciding board concluded (OJ EPO 2011, 633, point 5.2 of the Reasons, third-last paragraph; emphases added):\n\n\"Thus, in view of his general knowledge, as reflected in this excerpt from document (28), the skilled person, starting from the amorphous form of a pharmaceutically active compound as closest prior art, would have a clear expectation that a crystalline form thereof would provide a solution to the problem as defined under point 5.1 above. Although this might not be true of every crystalline form obtained (cf. document (28), page 527, left-hand column, second and third sentences), it was nevertheless obvious to try this avenue with a reasonable expectation of success without involving any inventive ingenuity.\"\n\n13.2 Hence, in this case, the deciding board held that the skilled person would have had a reasonable expectation that providing a crystalline form of the API would have solved the objective technical problem. The current case is different in that, first, the effect relied on for inventive step is different (filterability and drying characteristics in T 777/08 vs hygroscopicity in the case at hand) and, second, although a solution to the objective technical problem may have been suggested by D4, the skilled person would not have had a reasonable expectation that the solution offered by D4 would have solved this problem.\n\n14. In summary, the subject-matter of claim 1 involves an inventive step over amorphous dapagliflozin as disclosed in D1 in combination with D4 because the skilled person, considering the teaching of D4, would not have had a reasonable expectation of obtaining a form of dapagliflozin which is less hygroscopic than amorphous dapagliflozin.\n\nThe crystalline complex of dapagliflozin with L-phenylalanine as the starting point\n\n15. It was common ground between the parties that the subject-matter of claim 1 differs from the crystalline dapagliflozin/L-phenylalanine complex of D1, inter alia, in that the dapagliflozin component comprises (S)-PG and water (at a dapagliflozin:(S)-PG:water molar ratio of 1:1:1) instead of L-phenylalanine.\n\n16. According to the appellant, this distinguishing feature was not linked to a technical effect. The objective technical problem, therefore, had to be considered that of providing a pharmaceutical composition comprising an alternative crystalline form of dapagliflozin, and its solution was obvious in view of D4.\n\n17. The board does not agree with this for the following reasons.\n\n17.1 The appellant conceded, and the board shares this view, that the skilled person, faced with the objective technical problem of providing an alternative crystalline form of dapagliflozin, would not have used the crystalline dapagliflozin/L-phenylalanine complex as such in crystallisation attempts according to D4. The skilled person would have turned to amorphous dapagliflozin as disclosed in D1. This is simply because D4 only uses the APIs themselves (or their alkali metal salts) for the preparation of the corresponding API PG solvates; not compounds which would be comparable to a complex of an API with another organic compound, such as the crystalline complex of dapagliflozin with L-phenylalanine. This conclusion is tantamount to stating either that the crystalline dapagliflozin/L-phenylalanine complex of D1 when combining it with D4 would have turned out to be not suitable for this combination to solve the objective technical problem, or that the skilled person, when starting from this crystalline complex of D1, would not have taken into account the teaching of D4.\n\n17.2 In so far as the appellant concedes that the skilled person in starting from the crystalline dapagliflozin/L-phenylalanine complex of D1 would have used the amorphous dapagliflozin of D1 to prepare form SC-3 according to claim 1, it concedes that its objection of inventive step in fact does not start from the crystalline complex but from amorphous dapagliflozin. When starting from the amorphous dapagliflozin disclosed in D1, an inventive step has to be acknowledged as set out above.\n\nThe need to resort to amorphous dapagliflozin means that the crystalline dapagliflozin/L-phenylalanine complex as the starting point requires at least one further step to arrive at the claimed solution than if starting from amorphous dapagliflozin, namely the isolation of amorphous dapagliflozin from the crystalline complex. In other words, the crystalline complex must be more remote from the claimed subject-matter than amorphous dapagliflozin, over which an inventive step is to be acknowledged (see above). Therefore, an inventive step must, a fortiori, be acknowledged if the crystalline complex is taken as a more remote starting point.\n\nConclusion\n\n18. Thus, the subject-matter of claim 1 involves an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC. The reasoning above applies, mutatis mutandis, also to the subject-matter of dependent claims 2 to 5. The appellant did not raise any objection against these dependent claims. The set of claims of the main request is allowable.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The appeal was filed by the applicant (appellant) against the decision of the examining division to refuse the European patent application.\n\nII. The examining division issued the decision to refuse the application using the standard form for decisions according to the state of the file, by reference to the communications dated 8 July 2022, 27 May 2022 and 1 December 2021.\n\nThe decision was based on a main request corresponding to the application as filed (as a divisional) on 31 August 2021, and on auxiliary request 1 filed on 21 March 2022.\n\nClaim 1 of the main request related to:\n\n\"A trace element solution, which comprises at least the following metals:\n\n(a) zinc in a concentration of at least 60mg/ml;\n\n(b) manganese in a concentration of at least 10mg/ml;\n\n(c) selenium in a concentration of at least 5mg/ml; and\n\n(d) copper in a concentration of at least 15mg/ml;\n\nand which comprises a concentration of the metals of at least 90 mg/ml.\"\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 1 additionally specified that \"the solution further comprises EDTA.\"\n\nIII. The communications referred to in the decision cited the following document:\n\nD1: WO 02/17933 A1\n\nIV. In their latest referred communication dated 8 July 2022, the examining division provided the following reasoning regarding compliance with Article 84 EPC:\n\nFirstly, the main request lacked support under Article 84 EPC. It was the process of manufacturing that provided the trace element in solution. The method therefore provided the technical characteristics of the product, which were not achieved by the prior art using a different method. Claim 1 thus lacked support by lacking the essential features defining the identity of the product.\n\nSecondly, claim 1 defined the trace element solution by a result to be achieved, namely trace elements at high concentrations being able to remain in solution, which was in essence the problem underlying the application. The beneficial effect of reducing stress and injury to the animals was an obvious and direct consequence of providing a more concentrated solution. Claim 1 did not state the essential features necessary to achieve this result, i.e. high concentrations which remain in solution.\n\nAuxiliary request 1 contravened Article 84 EPC essentially for the same reasons as for the main request.\n\nV. With their grounds of appeal, the appellant upheld the main request and auxiliary request underlying the appealed decision, and submitted essentially the following arguments:\n\nClaim 1 related to a composition containing the listed elements in solution in the specified high concentration. This allowed a single injection, thus reducing pain and distress for the animal compared to administering multiple injections, while providing an improved balance of zinc, copper, manganese and selenium. The inventors were the first to find a way to make the claimed solution. The claims were accordingly directed at the product, i.e. the solution, per se, and were clearly defined and supported by the description in accordance with Article 84 EPC.\n\nContrary to the examining division's view, claim 1 did not lack any essential features because the method of making the claimed product had not been shown to be an essential feature of that product. Furthermore, the claim was not defined exclusively by the result to be achieved, but simply recited the concentration of certain elements in a solution and did not contain any functional definitions that could represent an unallowable result to be achieved.\n\nAccordingly, the criteria of Article 84 EPC were met.\n\nVI. The appellant requests that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the case be remitted to the examining division for the grant of a patent on the basis of the main request filed on 31 August 2021, or alternatively on the basis of auxiliary request 1 filed on 21 March 2022.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The present decision is based on the appellant's main request corresponding to the application as filed (as a divisional) on 31 August 2021 (see 2. below).\n\nThe appealed decision acknowledged that the main request met the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC and of novelty (see the referred communication dated 1 December 2021, §1 and §6). The Board sees no reason to set aside these findings.\n\nThe appealed decision further addressed inventive step (see §7 of the same referred communication), and noted that an inventive step would be acknowledged after filing of the same comparative data as in the parent application, namely experimental reports 1 and 2, and provided the claims were reformulated to meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC. Experimental reports 1 and 2 have in the meantime been filed on 21 March 2022. The application was however refused for lack of compliance with Article 84 EPC.\n\nThe Board considers that the main request meets the requirements of inventive step as it stands (see 3.), and that no reformulation is necessary for the main request to meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC (see 4.).\n\n2. The claimed invention; disclosure in the application\n\n2.1 The application relates to a solution containing trace elements useful for administration to mineral deficient animals such as livestock. It seeks to address the problem of low concentrations of the minerals in injectable solutions, leading to the injection of large quantities, which causes tissue damage and abscesses at the site of injection. The invention aims at providing solutions with suitable composition with high enough concentrations and sufficient ratios and sufficient concentrations of the various metals (see pages 1 and 3 of the description).\n\nClaim 1 of the main request relates to a trace element solution, which comprises at least the following metals:\n\n(a) zinc in a concentration of at least 60 mg/ml;\n\n(b) manganese in a concentration of at least 10 mg/ml;\n\n(c) selenium in a concentration of at least 5 mg/ml; and\n\n(d) copper in a concentration of at least 15 mg/ml;\n\nand which comprises a concentration of the metals of at least 90 mg/ml.\n\nIn agreement with the appellant and the examining division, the Board interprets claim 1 as requiring that the recited trace elements (namely zinc, manganese, selenium and copper) are present in solution, i.e. dissolved, in the stated concentrations.\n\n2.2 It is not under debate that the application sufficiently discloses a method for preparing the claimed composition. The description describes a general method (see page 3) consisting essentially of the steps of:\n\n(a) heating water;\n\n(b) adding manganese carbonate to the water;\n\n(c) adding zinc oxide to the water; and\n\n(d) adding copper carbonate to the water to form a liquid mixture;\n\n(e) adding a dry mixture comprising EDTA and/or EDDS and NaOH to the liquid mixture; and\n\n(f) adding Na2SeO3 to form the trace element solution.\n\nThis method is exemplified on pages 7-8 and is shown to lead to the claimed trace element solution. This is further supported by the experimental report 1 filed on 21 March 2022.\n\n3. Inventive step\n\n3.1 The closest prior art D1 (see example 6) shows a trace element solution comprising zinc (20 mg/ml), manganese (20 mg/ml), copper (10 mg/ml), chromium (5 mg/ml) and selenium (5 mg/ml), thus having a total concentration of metals of 60 mg/ml. The trace element solution of claim 1 differs from this known composition at least by its higher metals concentration, namely 90 mg/ml or more. This higher concentration addresses the problem of tissue damage and abscesses associated with the injection of large quantities (see page 1 of the description).\n\n3.2 The desirability of a higher metal concentration and the ensuing advantages upon injection are known from D1 (see page 1) and are as such obvious. However, it is apparent that, at the date of filing of the application, there was no obvious way to produce a solution as claimed with a metal concentration of at least 90 mg/ml.\n\n3.2.1 As noted by the examining division (see communication dated 8 July 2022, paragraph bridging pages 2 and 3), the prior art does not disclose a process amenable to the production of the claimed high concentrations. The experimental report 2 filed on 21 March 2022 shows that carrying out the process of D1 with increased trace element concentrations so as to achieve an overall metals concentration of 90 mg/ml does not lead to a clear solution but to a composition that contains a significant amount of precipitate, thus indicating that the trace elements are not in solution and that the concentration of 90 mg/ml cannot be reached. In contrast, the process disclosed in the present application allows the preparation of solution with the claimed high metals concentration.\n\n3.2.2 Both the process of D1 (see examples 1-6) and the process disclosed in the present application use the same ingredients (namely water, zinc oxide, manganese carbonate, copper carbonate, EDTA and Na2SeO3). However, their order of addition differs: the prior art teaches to first prepare the EDTA complexes of each trace elements, and then to combine them together to form the solution. In contrast, the process of the present application involves first mixing the trace elements together and then adding the complexing agent. As noted in the appealed decision, the increased concentration of trace elements in solution is obtained in particular by a specific order of adding EDTA. The prior art does not allow the skilled person to anticipate that this particular order of addition would lead to the claimed higher concentrations, nor does it appear to suggest any obvious way leading to such high concentrations.\n\n3.2.3 According to established case law, a product which can be envisaged as such with all characteristics determining its identity including its properties in use, i.e. an otherwise obvious entity, might nevertheless become non-obvious and claimable as such, if there is no known way or applicable (analogous) method in the art for making it and the claimed methods for its preparation are therefore the first to achieve this and do so in an inventive manner (see the Case Law of the Boards of Appeal 10**(th) edition, 2022 I.D.9.20). Considering the particular circumstances of the case at hand and the absence of prior art leading in an obvious manner to metals concentrations of at least 90 mg/ml, the Board considers that this conclusion is applicable to the trace elements solutions of claim 1 which are thus claimable as such, as far as the requirements of inventive step are concerned. The Board thus concurs with the examining division that the subject-matter of the main request involves an inventive step.\n\n4. Article 84 EPC\n\nThe examining division however found that the criteria of Article 84 EPC were not met,\n\n- firstly because it was the process of manufacturing that provided the increased concentrations of trace elements in solution, such that claim 1 lacked support by lacking the essential features defining the identity of the product, and\n\n- secondly, because claim 1 defined the trace element solution by a result to be achieved, namely trace elements at high concentrations being able to remain in solution, which was in essence the problem underlying the application. However, claim 1 did not state the essential features necessary to achieve this result.\n\nFor the following reasons, the Board considers that claim 1 of the main request neither lacks essential features nor lacks support under Article 84 EPC.\n\n4.1 Essential features\n\n4.1.1 In the case law of the Boards of Appeal, the requirement for all essential features to be specified in the claim has been inferred from the the criteria of clarity and of support by the description set out in Article 84 EPC.\n\nThus, a claim which does not include a feature which is described in the application (on the proper interpretation of the description) as an essential feature of the invention, and which is therefore inconsistent with the description, is not supported by the description for the purpose of Article 84 EPC (see the Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 10**(th) edition, 2022, II.A.5.1).\n\nFurthermore, Article 84 EPC has to be interpreted as meaning not only that a claim must be comprehensible from a technical point of view, but also that it must define the object of the invention clearly, that is to say it must indicate all the essential features thereof. In this context, all features which are necessary for solving the technical problem with which the application is concerned have to be regarded as essential features (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 10**(th) edition, 2022, II.A.3.2).\n\n4.1.2 Here, claim 1 is directed at a product as such, namely a trace element solution. It clearly defines the solution by its technical features, i.e. the types and amounts of the trace elements (zinc, manganese, selenium and copper) dissolved therein. Beyond these structural technical features of claim 1, the description does not, at any point, describe any additional feature as essential to the product or necessary for solving the problem of that these high concentrations seek to address, i.e. avoiding the injection of large quantities causing tissue damage and abscesses, and providing sufficient ratios and sufficient concentrations of the various metals.\n\n4.1.3 The examining division argued that it was the process of manufacturing, and in particular the specific order of adding EDTA, that provided the trace element in solution.\n\nAs a preliminary remark, claim 1 relates to a product per se. Additionally defining this product in terms of the process used for its preparation, i.e. by a product-by-process feature, could only further characterise the composition insofar as this process gives rise to a distinct and identifiable characteristic of the product. In this sense, the steps of the process cannot themselves be regarded as essential features of the product: at most the technical features imparted by this process to the resulting product could represent such essential features.\n\nThe Board understands the examining division's conclusions to be motivated by the finding that the preparation of a trace elements solution with the claimed high concentration could not be achieved in the prior art and was part of the problem to be solved mentioned in the application, and that the process disclosed in the application was the first process to allow such a preparation (as explained above, see 3.2). However this situation does not justify that each and every feature imparted by the process shown in the example to the resulting composition be seen as an essential feature. As explained in T 242/92, the mere fact that only one way of carrying out the invention is indicated does not in itself offer grounds for considering that the application is not entitled to broader claims (see point 3 of the reasons). A lack of support would only arise if there are well-founded reasons for believing that the skilled person would be unable to extend the particular teaching of the description to the whole of the field claimed by using routine methods. The Board sees no such reasons in the present case. In particular, the absence of reference in claim 1 to the EDTA used in the example does not lead to a lack of support, considering that the description mentions EDDS as an alternative, and considering the absence of an indication that the skilled person could not use other chelants. The examining division did not clearly identify which other features of the composition would be imparted by the process of the description but would be both missing from claim 1 and causing a lack of support. In as far as the process imparts a high trace element concentration to the resulting solution, this feature is already present in claim 1.\n\n4.1.4 Definition in terms of a result to be achieved\n\nIn a second line of reasoning, the examining division relied on T 809/12. According to this decision (see point 2.8 of the reasons), if an independent claim contains a feature defined by a result to be achieved which essentially corresponds to the problem underlying the application, to comply with Article 84 EPC the remaining features of the claim must comprise all essential features necessary for achieving that result.\n\nIn the case underlying T 809/12, claim 1 pertained to a claimed coated article defined in terms of the result to be achieved (by a DeltaE* value which corresponded essentially to the effect of improved matchability aimed at by the invention), but lacked a feature regarding the structure of the claimed article (namely feature (ii) about the thickness of some specified dielectric layer(s)) which the Board determined to be essential for obtaining the claimed result. The Board concluded that the requirements of Article 84 EPC were not met (see points 2.1-2.10 of the reasons).\n\nThis earlier decision is not applicable to the case at hand. The examining division did not determine which feature of the trace element solution would be missing from claim 1 and would be essential for obtaining the high concentration recited in claim 1. For the reasons given above (see 4.1.3), even if, according to the description, the invention aims at providing a highly concentrated trace element solution, and provides for the first time a process allowing the preparation of such a highly concentrated solution, this does not mean that the claims should be limited to that particular process or to a solution defined in terms of that particular process for them to comply with Article 84 EPC.\n\nAccordingly, the main request meets the requirements of Article 84 EPC.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. European patent 3 110 399 (\"the patent\") was granted on the basis of sixteen claims.\n\nIndependent claim 1 as granted defines:\n\n\"A process for producing a stable, injectable solution containing from 0.04 to 0.20 mg/ml noradrenaline, characterized by including the following steps:\n\na. dissolving noradrenaline and optionally an excipient in deoxygenated or degassed water, to obtain a concentration of noradrenaline from 0.04 to 0.20 mg/ml,\n\nb. adjusting the pH of the resulting solution by adding hydrochloric acid until a value in the range from 3.2 to 3.6 is achieved,\n\nc. filtrating the resulting noradrenaline solution in an inert gas current,\n\nd. distributing the noradrenaline solution in an inert gas current,\n\ne. sterilizing the noradrenaline solution\".\n\nIndependent claim 9 as granted defines:\n\n\"A stable injectable noradrenaline solution with an amount of preservatives and/or antioxidizing\n\nagents lower than 0.005% by weight, wherein solvent is degassed or deaerated water, the concentration of noradrenaline is in the range from 0.04 to 0.2 mg/ml and pH is from 3.2 to 3.6 by hydrochloric acid.\"\n\nII. The patent was opposed on the grounds that its subject-matter lacked an inventive step.\n\nThe patent proprietor filed the appeal against the decision of the opposition division to revoke the patent.\n\nIn its decision the opposition division cited inter alia the following documents:\n\nD1: US 2005/0070613 A1\n\nD2: Spectrochim Acta Part A, 2005, 61, 3139-3144\n\nD3: Clin Chem, 1993; 39/12, 2503-2508\n\nD4: CN102525895B\n\nD4a: Translation of D4\n\nD5: SPC Noradrenaline (Norepinephrine) 1 mg/ml Concentrate for Solution for Infusion\n\nD7: Study Report: Diluted noradrenaline (RD080C), 13 November 2015\n\nD9: Study Report: Diluted Noradrenaline, (RD080C, Addendum 3), 12 September 2019\n\nThe opposition division arrived at the following conclusions:\n\n(a) Document D1 represented the closest prior art describing the preparation of stable injectable aqueous solutions of catecholamines, including a solution of noradrenaline in a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, which are free of antioxidants and preservatives and in which oxidation and racemization is reduced by deoxygenation of the aqueous solution with an inert gas and adjustment of the pH to values over 3.0 and below 5.0.\n\nThe teaching of document D1 with respect to the disclosure of a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml noradrenaline could not be recognized as manifestly erroneous and misrepresenting the intended technical reality.\n\n(b) In line with the established jurisprudence on the assessment of novelty of sub-ranges the feature of the adjustment of the pH within the range of 3.2 to 3.6 did not represent a distinguishing feature with respect to the range of the pH of 3.0 to 5.0 described in document D1. In particular, the exemplified pH value of 3.1 in document D1 practically overlapped with the lower limit of the claimed range taking account of measurement errors. Moreover, in view of the teaching in document D1 to keep the pH at values between 3.0 and 5.0, such as 3.1 and higher, the skilled person would seriously contemplate applying the teaching of document D1 in the range of overlap. Document D9, which was in addition to document D7 relied upon by the proprietor to demonstrate effects associated with the defined pH adjustment, was admitted into the proceedings. However, even if the alleged effects were considered proven, the claimed pH range could not be distinguished from the range disclosed in document D1 by virtue of such effects.\n\n(c) The only difference between the subject-matter of claims 1 and 9 as granted and the teaching of document D1 was the definition of HCl used to adjust the pH of the solution. The technical problem was seen in the provision of a suitable pH adjusting agent. The use of HCl was a trivial choice from commonly known pH adjusting agents. The subject-matter of claims 1 and 9 did therefore not involve an inventive step.\n\nIII. The following additional documents have been submitted during the appeal procedure:\n\nD10: Expert Declaration by Alain Borgeat (21 April 2020)\n\nD11: Study Report: Diluted Noradrenaline (RD080C, Addendum 4), 28 April 2020\n\nD12: US 2013/0123298 A1\n\nD13: WO 2004/000219 A2\n\nD14: Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy, 2019, Vol. 45, 379-386\n\nThe appellant filed documents D10 and D11 with the statement of grounds of appeal and document D14 with the letter of 2 March 2021.\n\nThe respondent (opponent) filed documents D12 and D13 with the reply to the appeal.\n\nIV. The Board issued a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA on 20 June 2022.\n\nOral proceedings were held on 31 January 2023.\n\nV. The arguments of the appellant relevant to the present decision are summarized as follows:\n\nDocument D1 represented the closest prior art.\n\nAs confirmed by document D10 the skilled person would recognize that the reference to a noradrenaline concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in claim 11 of document D1 was erroneous. In as far as document D1 was nevertheless considered to disclose a noradrenaline concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, the document did not disclose this concentration in combination with the specific range of 3.2 to 3.6 for the pH and the selection of HCl for the pH adjustment as defined in the claims of the patent.\n\nThe claimed invention allowed for the preparation of a particularly stable injectable solution containing a low concentration of noradrenaline. The patent reported low levels of racemization, artenone and other impurities in exemplified solutions after sterilization and storage. The patent specifically indicated that the defined pH range was found to be critical for avoiding racemization and the formation of the degradation product arterenone. The criticality of the defined range for the pH was confirmed by the additional experimental results reported in document D9.\n\nThe prior art provided the skilled person with no suggestion that the adjustment of the pH between 3.2 and 3.6 allowed for the preparation of dilute noradrenaline solutions for injection which were particularly stable.\n\nVI. The arguments of the respondent relevant to the present decision are summarized as follows:\n\nDocument D1 was a suitable starting point in the prior art. Documents D4 and D5 represented alternative suitable starting points.\n\nDocument D1 described in claim 11 a solution of noradrenaline in a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, which stood by itself as a realistic teaching. The declaration in document D10 to the contrary was without justification only filed with the statement of grounds of appeal and actually lacked pertinence. Documents D12 and D13 further confirmed that dilute noradrenaline solutions with a concentration up to 0.2 mg/ml were conventional in the art.\n\nStarting from the embodiment of claim 11, the pH of the solution was according to the general teaching of document D1 to be adjusted to a value above 3.0 and below 5.0, preferably 3.1. The definition of the range for the pH of 3.2 to 3.6 according to the patent did not represent a distinguishing feature with respect to the values for the pH described in document D1.\n\nThe only difference between the claimed subject-matter and the teaching in document D1 concerned the definition of HCl as the pH adjusting agent. As solution to the problem of providing a suitable agent for the pH adjustment the use of HCl was conventional, as confirmed by documents D2 and D5, and therefore obvious to skilled person.\n\nIn as far as the definition of the pH range of 3.2 to 3.6 was nevertheless regarded as a further distinguishing feature, it only contributed to the solution of the partial problem of providing a further noradrenaline solution for injection. Neither the patent nor the post-published documents D7 and D9 supported the criticality of defined range for the pH of 3.2-3.6 with regard to racemization and the formation of arterenone as suggested in paragraph [0048] of the patent. Document D14, which was relied upon by the appellant to support the relevance of the data in document D9, lacked pertinence and was not to be admitted for being late filed. Document D9 actually concluded on the basis of the reported results that the arterenone levels were not affected by an increase of the pH from 3.6 to 3.7. Document D11, which was only filed with the statement of grounds of appeal and presented further post-published evidence, should not be admitted. The post-published evidence should furthermore not be taken into account as evidence of effects that could not be deduced from the application as filed.\n\nAs solution to the problem of providing a further stable noradrenaline solution for injection the adjustment of the pH within the range of 3.2 to 3.6 defined in the claims was obvious to the skilled person in view of the warning in document D1 concerning the risk of racemization below a pH of 3.0 and the explicit instruction in document D1 to adjust the pH above 3.0 and below 5.0. Moreover, as documents D2, D3 and D5 indicated particular stability of noradrenaline solutions at pH values within the claimed range it was obvious to the skilled person to adjust the pH to such values to improve the stability.\n\nThe appellant's reliance on the post-published data justified a stay of the proceedings until the issue of a decision by the Enlarged Board of Appeal with respect to the referral pending under G 2/21.\n\nVII. The appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be maintained as granted (main request).\n\nThe appellant further requested that documents D10, D11 and D14 as well as the statements that document D1 does not disclose distributing the solution in an inert gas current (feature d) and that document D4 does not disclose the use of deoxygenated/degassed/deaerated water (feature a) be admitted into the appeal proceedings.\n\nVIII. The respondent requested that the appeal be dismissed.\n\nThe respondent also requested, that documents D12 and D13 be admitted and that documents D10, D11 and D14 not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.\n\nMoreover, the respondent requested that statements by the appellant that document D1 does not disclose feature d) of claim 1 as granted and that document D4 does not disclose feature a) of claim 1 as granted not be admitted.\n\nThe respondent further requested that the proceedings be stayed until the Enlarged Board of Appeal has issued a decision with respect to the pending referral G 2/21.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\nMain request - Inventive step\n\n1. Closest prior art\n\n1.1 The patent relates to the stabilisation of noradrenaline solutions at low concentration against chemical degradation, in particular racemization and oxidation, while avoiding the use of antioxidants or preservatives by using deoxygenated water in combination with the adjustment of the pH to a value within 3.2 and 3.6 (see patent paragraphs [0001],[0023] and [0027] to [0031]).\n\n1.2 Document D1 describes the stabilisation of solutions of catecholamines without antioxidants or preservatives, including a solution of noradrenaline at 0.2 mg/ml, involving the deoxygenation of the aqueous solvent and adjusting the pH to values above 3.0 and below 5.0 to avoid racemization, which may become significant at a pH less than 3.0 (see D1, paragraphs [0003]-[0004], [0006],[0015]-[0022], [0047]-[0049] and claims 1, 6 and 11).\n\n1.3 Document D4 does not specifically address the stabilisation of diluted noradrenaline solutions and by requiring a pH between 2.3 and 4.3 does not recognize the relevance of a pH above 3.0 to avoid racemization (see translation D4a, claims 1 and 3). Document D5 does also not address the stabilisation of diluted noradrenaline solutions. Whilst document D5 describes a pH between 3 and 4 for a stable concentrated solution, it does not indicate a particular pH for the diluted solutions to be prepared from the concentrated solution. Moreover, document D5 does not require any deoxygenation (see D5 sections 2, 3, 6.3 and 6.6).\n\n1.4 Documents D4 and D5 are thus decisively more remote from the claimed invention than document D1. Accordingly, the Board considers document D1 to represent the most promising starting point in the prior art.\n\nFollowing these considerations the respondent's request not to admit the statements by the appellant that document D4 does not disclose feature a) of claim 1 remains without consequence.\n\n2. Relevant differences with the closest prior art\n\n2.1 It was not in dispute that the use of HCl for the pH adjustment represents a distinguishing feature of the claimed subject-matter with respect to the teaching of document D1.\n\n2.2 The appellant maintained that the skilled person would recognize the disclosure of the noradrenaline concentration of 0.2 mg/ml defined in claim 11 of document D1 as erroneous and that document D1 did not describe dilute noradrenaline solutions as defined in the claims of the patent.\n\nIn this matter the Board agrees with the finding in the decision under appeal (see pages 11-13, section 2.3.1.4) that the stand-alone disclosure of a noradrenaline concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in claim 11 of document D1 does not represent an immediately recognisable erroneous disclosure and therefore cannot be ignored. The comprehensive explanations in the decision already address the arguments in the statement of grounds of appeal and document D10. The respondent's request not to admit document D10 remains therefore without consequence.\n\n2.3 The respondent argued that starting from the disclosure of the embodiment involving a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml noradrenaline in claim 11 of document D1 the definition of the pH range of 3.2 to 3.6 would not represent a further distinguishing feature of the claimed subject-matter. The respondent referred to the principles established in the jurisprudence regarding the assessment of novelty of sub-ranges, in particular T 230/07, which according to further jurisprudence (T 1404/14, T 1027/08, T 2381/09) were also applicable for the identification of the distinguishing features in the assessment of inventive step. In accordance with these principles the claimed pH range of 3.2 to 3.6, which was not narrow with respect to range of 3.0 to 5.0 and close to the exemplified value of 3.1 described in document D1, could not further distinguish the claimed subject-matter.\n\nThe Board observes, however, that document D1 discloses the pH value of 3.1 in the context of examples which comprise noradrenaline in a concentration of 0.2%, 0.025% and 0.1 % (see D1, paragraphs [0047] to [0057]), corresponding to 2.0, 0,25 and 1.0 mg/ml, rather than the 0.04 to 0.20 mg/ml as defined in the claims of the patent. These examples thereby illustrate that in addition to choosing HCl as pH adjusting agent the skilled person would have to select the concentration of 0.2 mg/ml noradrenaline in combination with the more narrowly defined pH range of 3.2 to 3.6 in order to arrive from the teaching in document D1 at a dilute noradrenaline solution as defined in the claims of the patent. In accordance with the established jurisprudence (see T 1152/16, section 10.5; T 653/93, section 3.6; T 929/00, section 2.6) such a combined selection of features distinguishes the claimed subject-matter in the absence of a specific pointer in the prior art towards such combination. In the present case document D1 provides in the mentioned examples at best a pointer towards a pH of 3.1, which falls outside the range for the pH as defined in the claims.\n\nAccordingly, the Board concludes that the definition of the noradrenaline concentration of 0.04 to 0.20 mg/ml in combination with the definition of the pH ranges of 3.2 to 3.6 further distinguishes the claimed subject-matter from the closest prior art.\n\n3. Problem to be solved\n\nThe patent presents in paragraph [0048] the following statement:\n\n\"The Applicant has indeed verified that pH values of the solution higher than 3.6 cause an increase of the formation of arterenone, while pH values lower than 3.2 have greater incidence in the appearance of d-noradrenaline.\"\n\nAccording to the Board the patent provides thereby a verifiable statement regarding the effect of the claimed invention.\n\nThe respondent did not provide any experimental results of his own to challenge this statement in the patent. The respondent relied instead on the results reported in document D9 to argue that the claimed range for the pH was contrary to the statement in paragraph [0048] of the patent not associated with the particular advantage with respect to racemization and the formation of arterenone.\n\nIn this context the Board notes that document D9 indeed reports (see D9, page 4/7, first sentence) that after storage of relevant solutions for four weeks at 60°C the arterenone percentages varied across the sub-batches at pH 3.7, 3.6, 3.2 and 3.1 between 0.1 and 0.2, which did not imply any significant difference. However, document D9 (see page 3/7, first two tables) indicates increased levels of arterenone percentages at pH 3.7 in the first two weeks of storage, which in the subsequent two weeks decreased with a concomitant increase in the total of unknown impurities. As was pointed out by the appellant this subsequent decrease of the arterenone concentration at pH 3.7 may in view of the reported increase in the total of unknown impurities well be explained by the further degradation of the initially formed arterenone to other unknown impurities. Document D9 further apparently confirms the increased racemization rate below pH 3.2 (see D9, page 5/7, figure \"Trend slopes vs pH\").\n\nThe experimental results reported in document D9 do therefore not invalidate, but rather corroborate the statement in paragraph [0048] of the patent regarding the criticality of the defined pH range of 3.2 to 3.6 with respect to the stability of the diluted noradrenaline solutions. Following these considerations the respondent's request not to admit documents D11 and D14 remains without consequence.\n\nAccordingly, the Board is satisfied that the problem to be solved in view of document D1 may be formulated as the provision of particularly stable dilute noradrenaline solutions for injection.\n\n4. Assessment of the solution\n\n4.1 Document D1 itself teaches in relation to the disclosed pH range of 3.0 to 5.0 that below pH 3.0 racemization may be significant (paragraph [0019]) and that in experiments carried out to fix the optimal conditions of use the pH of the solutions was adjusted to 3.1 (see D1, paragraphs [0047] to [0057]. Document D1 does thereby not provide any suggestion that particular stability of a dilute noradrenaline solution is achieved by adjusting the pH of the solution in the range of 3.2 to 3.6 as defined in the claims.\n\n4.2 Document D2 mentions pH values of 3.4 and 3.55 in the context of the spectral behaviour of diluted noradrenaline solutions during titration over a broad pH range (see D2, item 3.1 / Figure 2 and item 3.3 / Figure 7). However document D2 does thereby not indicate any particular stability of the noradrenaline solutions at the pH values of 3.4 and 3.55.\n\nDocument D3 recommends acidification for stabilizing catecholamines, including noradrenaline, in plasma and urine during storage prior to measurement and mentions in this context a pH of 3.2 (see page 2505, right column and page 2508, left column). The Board is not convinced that such recommendation in the context of the analyse of plasma and urine samples provides the skilled person with a relevant suggestion towards the particular stability of the dilute noradrenaline solutions for injection as defined in the claims.\n\nDocument D5 mentions a pH between 3 and 4 for a stable concentrated noradrenaline solution, but does not indicate any particular pH for the diluted solutions to be prepared from the concentrated solution, let alone any particular stability of diluted noradrenaline solutions associated with the pH range of 3.2 to 3.6 defined in the claims of the patent.\n\nDocument D12 mentions dilute noradrenaline solutions (see D12, paragraph [0049], but fails to provide any suggestion towards the particular stability of such solutions by adjustment of the pH in the range of 3.2 to 3.6.\n\nDocument D13 mentions noradrenaline as an example of alpha adrenergic receptor agonists (see D13, page 10 lines 17-20), but only mentions low concentrations (1 mg/ml or less) and specific pH values (including a pH of 3.5) for formulations of alpha adrenergic receptor antagonists (see D13, page 11, lines 11-14 and page 23, lines 5-10).\n\n4.3 Accordingly, taking account of the prior art the claimed subject-matter was not obvious as solution to the problem of providing particularly stable dilute noradrenaline solutions for injection.\n\nThe Board therefore concludes that the claimed subject-matter involves an inventive step.\n\nAs this conclusion is not based on feature d) as a distinguishing characteristic of the claimed subject-matter, the respondent's objection to the admittance of the appellant's statement regarding this feature remains without consequence.\n\nRequest for a stay of the proceedings pending G 2/21\n\n5. The pending referral G 2/21 relates to the questions whether post-published evidence must be disregarded if the proof of a technical effect relied upon for an inventive step rests exclusively on the post-published evidence and whether such post-published evidence can be taken into consideration depending on the plausibility of the technical effect based on the information in the patent and the common general knowledge. As explained in sections 3 and 4 above, the Board concludes that the claimed subject-matter of claim 1 involves an inventive step taking account of a technical effect which is substantiated by a verifiable statement in the patent, which is only further corroborated by post-published experimental results. Any outcome of the referral is therefore not expected to affect the Boards considerations in the present appeal proceedings.\n\nThe Board has therefore rejected the respondent's request for a stay of the proceedings pending G 2/21.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. European patent No. 2 578 228 is based on European patent application No. 11789976.5 (published as WO2011/152618 on the 8 December 2011). The patent was opposed on the grounds of Article 100(a) in conjunction with Article 56 EPC, and of Articles 100(b) and (c) EPC. An opposition division considered that the main request extended beyond the content of the application as filed under Article 100(c) EPC and took the view that auxiliary request 1 and the description adapted thereto complied with the requirements of the EPC.\n\nII. Opponent (appellant) lodged an appeal against the decision of the opposition division.\n\nIII. The respondent (patent proprietor) did not reply in substance to the statement of grounds of appeal.\n\nIV. Oral proceedings were requested as an auxiliary measure by both parties and the parties were summoned accordingly. Respondent withdrew its request with a letter dated 3 December 2021 and announced its non-attendance at the scheduled oral proceedings.\n\nV. In a communication sent in preparation of the oral proceedings, the board provided observations on procedural issues and expressed a provisional opinion on some issues concerning Articles 123(3), 84, 83 and 56 EPC.\n\nVI. Appellant withdrew its request for oral proceedings with a letter dated 23 December 2021. Oral proceedings were cancelled.\n\nVII. None of the parties replied in substance to the board's communication.\n\nVIII. Independent claims 1 to 3 of the main request read as follows:\n\n\"1. A method for purifying a non-spreading botulinum toxin, comprising the steps of: separating the botulinum toxin type A product into subfractions by conducting ion-exchange chromatography using pH 4.5-5.5 buffer and 0.02-0.2 M of sodium chloride (NaCl); and collecting a non-spreading botulinum toxin subfraction, which has an A260/A280 value of 0.4-0.6, from the said separated subfractions.\n\n2. A non-spreading botulinum toxin preparation, which is purified by the above method comprises, Zn, Fe and Mg ion concentrations at least 150, 80, and 140 ppb per 100 U/ml, respectively.\"\n\n3. A method for determining a non-spreading botulinum toxin, comprising injection the non-spreading botulinum toxin preparation of claim 2 into the either left or right hind limb calf muscle of mouse (4-6 wk old, weighing 18-22g) in an amount equivalent to 1.5-3 times the LD50 of the toxin; and determining whether the hind limb muscles injected and respiratory muscles of the mouse were paralyzed and whether the mouse died.\"\n\nDependent claim 4 defines a specific embodiment of the method of claim 3.\n\nIX. The following documents are referred to in this decision:\n\nD8:   \"Ion Exchange Chromatography & Chromatofocusing -\n\nPrinciples and Methods; Amersham Biosciences\n\n11-0004-21; pages 1 to 185;\n\nD23:  Tse CK, et al. \"Preparation and Characterisation\n\nof Homogeneous Neurotoxin Type A from Clostridium\n\nbotulinum.\" Eur. J. Biochem., 1 March 1982,\n\nvol. 122(3), pages 493 to 500, (1982).\n\nX. The submissions made by the appellant, insofar as relevant to the present decision, are summarized as follows:\n\nMain request (Auxiliary request 1 as maintained by the opposition division).\n\nInventive step (Article 56 EPC)\n\nDocument D23 represented the closest prior art with regard to the method of claim 1 and with regard to the non-spreading botulinum toxin of claim 2.\n\nDocument D23 related to the preparation and characterization of homogeneous neurotoxin type A from Clostridium botulinum. It described the isolation of Haemagglutinin-Neurotoxin complexes from culture medium by acid precipitation, clarified by centrifugation, re-extracted with buffer, pooled and subjected to ribonuclease treatment (see page 494, left column, 3**(rd) and 4**(th) paragraphs). The purification procedure was summarized in Table 1. A clear solution was subjected to ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column, equilibrated in a 0.05 M sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.5. The botulinum toxin was obtained in the void volume, and fractions having a 260/280 nm absorbance ratio of 0.54-0.58 were pooled.\n\nThe difference between the purification method of document D23 and of claim 1 was that the method of document D23 used a 0.05 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, whereas the method of claim 1 required the use of a buffer comprising 0.02-0.2 M of sodium chloride (NaCl).\n\nThe \"non-spreading\" effect was unclear.\n\nDid the method of claim 1 aim at further purifying a botulinum toxin that is already \"non-spreading\" or did it aim at separating a \"non-spreading\" botulinum toxin from a mixture of both \"spreading\" and \"non-spreading\" botulinum toxin? Was the botulinum toxin of claim 2 \"non-spreading\" by itself or was it the ingredients of the preparation that rendered it \"non-spreading\"?\n\nThe effect underlying the use of a different buffer in the method of claim 1 was unknown. The \"non-spreading\" effect of the botulinum toxin in claims 1 and 2 had no clear definition in the art. Hence, it could not be considered as a distinguishing feature over the prior art.\n\nThe difference between document D23 and the preparation of claim 2 was that it explicitly comprised Zn, Fe and Mg ion concentrations.\n\nHowever, it was unclear whether the \"non-spreading\" botulinum toxin preparation was non-spreading in itself or whether the components present in the preparation caused this property. It was further unclear whether the \"non-spreading\" botulinum toxin according to claim 2 purified by the method of the patent or by the method of document D23 were at all distinguishable.\n\nGiven that the \"subfraction pII obtained in Example 1\" and the \"commercial product\" defined as Allergan's Botox were prepared according to an unknown purification method, the preparations obtained thereby most certainly differed by more than only the Zn, Fe and Mg ion concentrations.\n\nIt was unclear whether the \"non-spreading\" effect of the toxin in the preparation could be assigned only to the Zn, Fe and Mg ion concentrations.\n\nSince neither the differences between the method of document D23 and the method of claim 1 nor the differences between the \"commercial product\" and the preparation of claim 2, were shown to result in a technical effect, the objective technical problem solved had to be formulated as the provision of an alternative process for purifying a botulinum toxin and as the provision of an alternative botulinum toxin preparation, respectively.\n\nThe technical problem of providing a product with an improved therapeutic range was not based on any evidence and comparison between the product disclosed in document D23 and claim 2. This technical problem was accordingly not solved.\n\nThe skilled person, faced with the technical problem of providing an alternative purification method to the one disclosed in document D23, would have turned to document D8, which mentioned that \"[T]he counter-ions (salt ions) used in IEX are almost always Na**(+) for cation exchange and Cl**(-) for anion exchange. Salts such as NaCl have a chaotropic character (i.e. an ability to make water less polar) and therefore a lower \"salting-out\" effect on hydrophobic molecules. This ensures maximum solubility during elution and improves recovery.\" (see page 38, heading \"Counter-Ions\"). Hence, there was a clear suggestion in the art to use NaCl for IEX, i.e. ion exchange chromatography.\n\nSince the botulinum toxin preparation defined in claim 2 comprising at least Zn, Fe and Mg ion concentrations could not be assigned a technical effect, the difference was simply an arbitrary modification which could not establish an inventive step.\n\nConsequently, the subject matter of claims 1 and 2  lacked an inventive step over document D23 in combination with document D8.\n\nXI. Appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be revoked.\n\nXII. Respondent requested that the appeal be dismissed, or alternatively, that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be maintained on the basis of auxiliary requests 2 or 3 filed on 7 January 2019.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The respondent made no substantive submissions in appeal proceedings, neither in reply to the statement of grounds of appeal nor to the board's communication. The board had duly taken the appellant's submissions into account and provided its preliminary opinion on the case in such communication. The appellant did not reply in substance to the board's communication. Hence, the board has no reason to change its view expressed in it and can issue the present decision in writing.\n\nMain request (claims 1 to 4) - (Auxiliary request 1 as maintained by the opposition division).\n\n2. The appellant raised objections under Articles 56, 84, 123(3), and 83 EPC. However, in view of the board's conclusion on inventive step of the main request (infra), there is no need to enter into a discussion of the merits of the other objections.\n\nInventive step (Article 56 EPC)\n\nClosest prior art\n\n3. In opposition proceedings, it was common ground between the parties that document D23 represents the closest prior art with regard to the method of claim 1 and the non-spreading botulinum toxin preparation according to claim 2.\n\n3.1 Document D23 relates to the preparation and characterization of homogeneous neurotoxin type A from Clostridium botulinum. It discloses the isolation of haemagglutinin-neurotoxin complexes (see Title, abstract point 1). The botulinum toxin is obtained from culture medium by acid precipitation, clarified by centrifugation, homogenized, re-extracted with buffer, pooled and incubated with ribonuclease. The ammonium sulfate sedimented toxin is redissolved in 50-100 ml 0.05 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, and dialysed against this solution at 4 °C. The brown pigment is removed by adding a half volume of swollen DEAE-Sephadex A-50. The clear solution is then loaded onto a column (90 x 8 cm) of DEAE-Sephacel equilibrated with the latter buffer; The toxin is eluted in the void volume and fractions having a 260/280 nm absorbance ratio of 0.54-0.58 were pooled (see page 494, col.1, \"Isolation of Haemagglutinin-Neurotoxin Complexes\", Table 1).\n\n3.2 Starting from document D23, the opposition division defined the technical problem to be solved as the provision of a method for obtaining botulinum toxin products with an improved therapeutic range.\n\n3.3 Appellant contended that the method according to claim 1 differed from the method of document D23 in that it related to a method for purifying a \"non-spreading\" botulinum toxin and in that the method used a buffer with 0.02-0.2 M of sodium chloride (NaCl). The botulinum toxin preparation defined in claim 2 differed from the one in document D23 in that it comprised Zn, Fe and Mg ions at specific concentrations and in that it was explicitly related to a \"non-spreading\" preparation.\n\nSince the purified toxin obtained in document D23 was not tested for its \"non-spreading\" activity, this property could not distinguish the process of claim 1 and the product of claim 2 from the prior art process and product.\n\nDespite the critical importance of the pH and the ionic strength of the buffer for ion exchange chromatography, it was neither clear nor had it been demonstrated that the use of an aqueous solution comprising 0.02-0.2 M of sodium chloride (NaCl) or of a 0.05 M sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.5 - taking into account the dissociation of citrate at pH 5.5 - would lead to any difference in the botulinum toxin preparation obtained after elution from the DEAE-Sephadex column.\n\n3.4 Since the ionic composition of Allergan's Botox was not determined, no specific effect could be assigned to the ionic composition, as the \"subfraction pII obtained in Example 1\" could differ from Allergan's Botox reference preparation by more than just the Zn, Fe and Mg ion concentrations.\n\n3.5 Appellant concluded that since no technical effect was clearly assignable to the differences identified above, the objective technical problem had to be reformulated in less ambitious terms as the provision of an alternative botulinum toxin preparation and the provision of an alternative process for purifying a botulinum toxin.\n\n3.6 The board agrees that there is no evidence in the patent application - or anywhere else - to demonstrate that the \"non-spreading\" effect of the botulinum toxin preparation defined in claim 2 is the direct consequence of the different buffer used in the method of claim 1 or the different ionic composition.\n\n3.6.1 In consequence, it is not possible, based on the results disclosed in the patent, to conclude that the technical problem defined by the opposition division  was actually solved (see test Examples 2 and 3 and Figs 5 to 8).\n\n3.7 Indeed, each of the two freeze-dried products (Allergan's Botox and the pII fraction) were dissolved in 10 ml of distilled water (see patent, test Example 3). Their ion contents were then measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (see Table 7). The content of ions of the pII fraction purified by the method of claim 1 is clearly higher than those present in the commercial product. In mass spectrometry, the ions are usually separated on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratio whereas the detector receives an ion signal that is proportional to the concentration of the tested solution (freeze-dried in 10 ml). Since the content of ions in the preparation of claim 2 is defined per 100 U/ml, it is unclear whether the reduced spread/diffusion of the active fraction pII may be supported by the effect assigned to the content of ions measured at a concentration of 100 U/10 ml (see Table 7). This view has been not contested.\n\n3.8 Hence, the technical problem is indeed formulated as the provision of an alternative botulinum toxin preparation and an alternative method of purifying the same.\n\n3.9 The solution is the method of claim 1 and the non-spreading botulinum toxin preparation of claim 2.\n\nObviousness\n\n3.10 It remains to be assessed whether the skilled person starting from the method or botulinum toxin preparation of the closest prior art and faced with the technical problem identified above would have arrived at the claimed method or the claimed preparation in an obvious manner.\n\n3.11 Document D8 explicitly mentions that \"The counter-ions (salt ions) used in IEX are almost always Na**(+) for cation exchange and Cl**(-) for anion exchange.\" (see page 38, heading \"Counter-Ions\"). Hence, there is a clear suggestion to use NaCl for IEX, i.e. ion exchange chromatography.\n\n3.12 Starting from the content of document D23, the skilled person faced with the problem of providing an alternative method of purifying botulinum toxin, without any particular effect, would have obviously replaced the sodium citrate buffer pH 5.5 by another buffer comprising NaCl, as disclosed in document D8 on page 38.\n\nThe method for purifying a botulinum toxin according to claim 1 and the botulinum toxin preparation defined in claim 2 are therefore obvious for a skilled person in the light of the teachings of documents D23 and D8.\n\nHence, the main request lacks an inventive step.\n\nAuxiliary requests 2 and 3 filed during opposition proceedings on 7 January 2019.\n\n4. Since claim 1 of the main request and auxiliary requests 2 and 3 is identical, the objections under Article 56 EPC set out above for the method according to claim 1 of the main request also apply mutatis mutandis to the method according to claim 1 of auxiliary requests 2 and 3.\n\n5. The board concludes that auxiliary requests 2 and 3 contravene Article 56 EPC.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. European patent No. 2 691 109, entitled \"Prevention of hypoglycaemia in diabetes mellitus type 2 patients\" was opposed under Article 100(a) and (b) EPC.\n\nII. By way of an interlocutory decision, the opposition division held that the patent on the basis of auxiliary request 6 complied with the requirements of the EPC.\n\nIII. Both the patent proprietor and the opponent filed an appeal against this decision.\n\nIV. With their statement of grounds of appeal the opponent (in the following \"appellant\") requested, inter alia, that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be revoked.\n\nV. Three written submissions were received from the patent proprietor (in the following \"respondent\"). In the last one, the respondent stated that they withdrew their appeal, and they requested, inter alia, as a main request, that the appeal be dismissed (i.e. that the patent be maintained on the basis of the set of claims which the opposition division considered to meet the requirements of the EPC) or, alternatively that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be maintained on the basis of the set of claims of an auxiliary request 1.\n\nVI. As both parties had requested oral proceedings on an auxiliary basis, the board issued a summons to oral proceedings and also a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA.\n\nVII. Oral proceedings were held on 14 October 2021. The appellant was not represented, as they had announced beforehand. At the end of the oral proceedings, the respondent stated that they withdrew all the pending requests as well as their agreement with the text of the patent as granted.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeal complies with Articles 106 to 108 and Rule 99 EPC and is admissible.\n\n2. The appellant did not attend the oral proceedings. The proceedings were continued in their absence; the appellant was treated as relying on their written case in view of Rule 115(2) EPC and Article 15(3) RPBA.\n\n3. According to Article 113(2) EPC, the European Patent Office shall decide upon the European patent only in the text submitted to it, or agreed, by the proprietor of the patent.\n\n4. Such an agreement is deemed not to exist if the patent proprietor - as in the present case - has withdrawn all the pending requests as well as their agreement with the text of the patent as granted.\n\n5. There is therefore no text on the basis of which the board can decide.\n\n6. It is established case law of the boards of appeal that, under these circumstances, the patent is to be revoked without further examination of the case as to patentability (see decision T 73/84, OJ EPO 1985, 241, followed by numerous decisions, see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 9th Edition 2019, IV.D.2). The board has no reason to deviate from this approach of the boards of appeal.\n\n7. There are also no ancillary issues that would have to be dealt with by the board in the present appeal case.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. European patent No. 1 005 318 was granted on the basis of a set of 12 claims.\n\nII. An opposition was filed under Article 100 (a) EPC on the grounds that its subject-matter lacked novelty and inventive step.\n\nIII. The patent was revoked a first time for lack of novelty of all requests. The opposition division decided also not to introduce the late filed ground of opposition pursuant to Article 100(b) EPC.\n\nIV. In its decision T 109/08, the Board decided to set the decision under appeal aside and to remit the case to the opposition division for substantive examination of the grounds pursuant to Article 100(b) EPC.\n\nV. The patent was revoked a second time for lack of compliance of the requests pursuant to Articles 123(2) and 123(3) EPC.\n\nVI. In its decision T 1444/13, the Board decided that the main request, the claims as granted, did not comply with Article 123(2) EPC, while auxiliary request 1 filed with letter of 23 August 2013 complied with Articles 123(2) and 123(3) EPC. The case was remitted to the opposition division for examination of the outstanding issues, in particular the ground of sufficiency of disclosure.\n\nVII. The present appeal lies from the decision of the opposition division finding that the patent in amended form meets the requirements of the EPC. The decision was based on the set of claims filed with letter of 23 August 2013 as auxiliary request 1.\n\nIndependent claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 read as follows:\n\n\"1. A dental composite comprising a resin base and about 11% by volume to about 80% by volume filler comprising a ground structural filler and a microfiller, wherein the ground structural filler comprises between about 10% by volume and about 70% by volume of the composite and comprises ground particles of mean particle size between about 0.05 µm and about 0.5 µm and contains less than 50% by volume of particles above 0.5 µm in diameter, and wherein the microfiller comprises between 1 and 10.0% by volume of the composite and comprises particles of mean particle size of about 0.04 µm or less.\"\n\nVIII. The documents cited during the opposition proceedings included the following:\n\nD10: table with calculations concerning the conversion from vol% to wt%\n\nDll: data sheet Aerosil OX 50\n\nD12: data sheet of Triethylene glycol dimethacrylate\n\nD13: data sheet of Bisphenol A glycolate dimethacrylate\n\nD14: declaration of the technical expert Dr. Ulf Drechsler\n\nD15: J. Oral Rehabilitation, 2004, 31, 1090-1101, J. Sabbagh et al.\n\nD16: Posterior Composite Resin Dental Restorative Materials, G. Vanherle and D.C. Smith, 1985\n\nIX. According to the decision under appeal, the opposed patent was sufficiently disclosed:\n\n- The considerations in points 4.2-4.9 of T 109/08 did not result in the patent being insufficiently disclosed. The fact that the examples related to weight% and that the claims referred to volume%, without any information in the patent about the density of the fillers and resins, did not prevent a conversion between these units and the workability of the claimed invention over the whole claimed scope.\n\n- It was accepted in the field of dentistry to express the percentage of fillers in volume% as confirmed by D14 and D15, and conversion could be done using the mathematical method referred to in D15 and the specific densities of the fillers and the resin which were in most cases provided by the manufacturer.\n\nX. The opponent (hereinafter the appellant) filed an appeal against said decision.\n\nXI. With a letter dated 9 August 2018, the patent proprietor (hereinafter the respondent) filed a main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 3. The main request corresponded to auxiliary request 1 as maintained by the opposition division.\n\nIndependent claim 1 of the auxiliary requests read as follows, difference(s) compared with claim 1 of the main request shown in bold or [deleted: stricken through] (deletion):\n\nAuxiliary request 1\n\nThe subject-matter of claim 1 of this request has been reformulated as follows:\n\n\"1. A dental composite comprising a resin base and about 11% by volume to about 80% by volume filler comprising a ground structural filler and a microfiller, wherein the ground structural filler comprises between about 10% by volume and about 70% by volume of the composite and comprises ground particles of mean particle size between about 0.05 µm and about 0.5 µm [deleted: and contains less than 50% by volume of particles above 0.5 µm in diameter][deleted: ,] and wherein the microfiller comprises between 1 and 10.0% by volume of the composite and comprises particles of mean particle size of about 0.04 µm or less, wherein the ground structural filler contains less than 50% by volume of particles above 0.5 µm in diameter.\"\n\nAuxiliary request 2\n\n\"1. A dental composite comprising a resin base and about 11% by volume to about 80% by volume filler comprising a ground structural filler and a microfiller, wherein the ground structural filler comprises between about 10% by volume and about 70% by volume of the composite and comprises ground particles of mean particle size between about 0.05 µm and about 0.5 µm [deleted: and contains less than 50% by volume of particles above 0.5 µm in diameter][deleted: ,] and wherein the microfiller comprises between 1 and 10.0% by volume of the composite and comprises particles of mean particle size of about 0.04 µm or less, wherein the ground structural filler contains less than 50% by volume of particles above 0.5 µm in diameter and less than 10% by volume of particles above 0.8 µm in diameter.\"\n\nAuxiliary request 3\n\n\"1. A dental composite comprising a resin base and about 11% by volume to about 80% by volume filler comprising a ground structural filler and a microfiller, wherein the ground structural filler comprises between about 10% by volume and about 70% by volume of the composite and comprises ground particles of mean particle size between about 0.05 µm and about 0.5 µm [deleted: and contains less than 50% by volume of particles above 0.5 µm in diameter][deleted: ,] and wherein the microfiller comprises between 1 and 10.0% by volume of the composite and comprises particles of mean particle size of about 0.04 µm or less, wherein the ground structural filler contains less than 50% by volume of particles above 0.5 µm in diameter and less than 10% by volume of particles above 0.8 µm in diameter.\"\n\nXII. A communication from the Board, dated 28 October 2019, was sent to the parties. In this, the Board expressed its doubts as regards sufficiency of disclosure.\n\nXIII. With a letter dated 23 March 2020, the respondent provided further arguments and at the same time informed the Board and the appellant that it would not be attending the oral proceedings, and requested that a decision on the appeal be made based on the arguments submitted in writing.\n\nXIV. Oral proceedings were cancelled.\n\nXV. The written arguments of the appellant may be summarised as follows:\n\nWith regard to sufficiency of disclosure, the problem was the use of the feature \"volume%\" in the claims, while the description and the examples used \"weight%\" only when determining amounts of fillers.\n\nThis question was already discussed in decision        T 109/08.\n\nDocument D10 was not sufficient to lay the groundwork for a general understanding of the disclosure with regard to the conversion of weight% to volume%. D10 only served as a model for an exemplary calculation in order to establish a general conversion constant of 1.4 for showing the lack of novelty over D5, by using the densities of the ingredients as disclosed in D11-D13. However, D10 did not show the conversion of the data in examples A-C of Table 3 of the contested patent from weight% to volume%, using the densities as disclosed in D11-D13.\n\nFirst the density of the barium aluminoborosilicate glass used in the examples was not known, and D11 only provided density values for \"Inert Dental Glasses\", which varied in a range of 2.6 to 3.0 g/cm**(3).\n\nD12 disclosed the density of Aerosil OX 50 used in examples A-C, which was disclosed as being about 2.2 g/cm**(3). This was not an exact value and could not be regarded as an enabling disclosure for a conversion from weight% to volume%.\n\nIt was not apparent why the opposition division completely ignored the teaching of D15, which disclosed that the technique of determining the percentage of filler by volume was not simple, since the density was difficult to measure due to the wide variation of filler morphologies. D15 showed the lack of reliability with regard to the values of densities given by the manufacturers, and mentioned that picnometric methods for measuring a percentage of fillers by volume showed wide variations.\n\nD14 could also not be used in support of sufficiency of disclosure, since this statement did not give any useful information which would provide a solution to the problems of densities of filler material disclosed in the contested patent.\n\nThis lack of precise determination of an important parameter resulted in a lack of enablement for the skilled person, at least over significant areas of the claimed subject-matter.\n\nXVI. The written arguments of the respondent may be summarised as follows:\n\nWhile the densities of different compositions of resin bases and filler particles might have varied, it was not the proportion of these components that was important, it was the proportion by volume. The skilled person could produce a composite that had a resin base and a specified volume of filler particles, as explained in the statement D14. D14 explained that it was common practice to convert the volume percentage required for each component into mass fractions and then to weigh out and to mix together the required mass fractions.\n\nThe physical relationship between density, mass and volume was well understood, and was taught to school students from an early age.\n\nThe person skilled in the art was well equipped to convert a volume of a specific type of filler particles to a corresponding weight, by for instance looking up the density of the specific filler particles, as provided by the supplier, or by measuring the densities of the filler particles directly by using a gas pycnometer and multiplying by the volume. D15 mentioned that it was possible to measure the percentage of fillers by volume by direct or indirect methods.\n\nMoreover, in the composite of the present invention, solid filler particles were surrounded by a resin matrix. Microfiller particles could be located within the interstices of the structural filler particles, but in order to be located there, the microfiller had to displace resin from the interstices. As the resin in the composite surrounded the filler particles and filled any gaps, there was no hidden gaps or air-filled interstices between particles that might have affected the overall volume and density of the composite. This meant that the volume of the resin, structural filler and microfiller of the composite were additive.\n\nIt was also clear that it was the absolute density of the material that should be used when converting the mass and volume of a material. This was the actual density of the actual substance and did not include any free space that may exist between particles. This absolute density was provided by the manufacturers' data sheet or could be measured by a number of known techniques, for example with a gas pycnometer.\n\nIt would be immediately clear to the skilled person that the powder characteristics of bulk/apparent/tapped density would not be used.\n\nHence, it was clear that the claimed invention was sufficiently disclosed.\n\nXVII. Requests\n\nThe appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be revoked.\n\nThe respondent requested that the appeal be dismissed, alternatively that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be maintained according to one of the sets of claims filed as auxiliary requests 1-3 with letter of 9 August 2018.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. Main request - Sufficiency of disclosure\n\n1.1 Claim 1 relates to a dental composite comprising a resin, a ground structural filler and a microfiller, only defined by their mean particle sizes and amounts in volume%.\n\nThe chemical nature and physical form of the resin and the fillers is in particular unspecified and totally open in the claims; the resin may include, according to the description, commercially available monomers of very different chemical natures, as shown in paragraphs [0029]-[0030] of the specification, and the filler materials are to be chosen from a broad palette of materials, as shown by the several different alternative possibilities given for the fillers in paragraph [0023] of the specification. The claimed subject-matter is therefore very broad and encompasses a great number of possibilities as to the fillers and the resin.\n\nThe structural filler is furthermore ground, which means it is not spherical, and has an irregular shape with interstices (see par. [0017] and [0014)]. The degree of grinding is also not specified in the claims.\n\nMoreover, in line with the consideration set out in point 2 of decision T 1444/13 , in view of the fact that claim 1 concerns a product as such, i.e. the dental composite material, the amounts of the different fillers specified in claim 1 relate to their volume percentages in the final composite dental material, i.e. in the product obtained after the combination of the fillers.\n\nThe question arises as to whether the skilled person would know what amounts of the different fillers should be combined in order to arrive at the claimed volumes after their combination.\n\n1.2 The description does not give any teaching on the approximative amounts in weight or even initial volumes of the different filler powders to be used to arrive at the claimed volumes% after combination.\n\nExamples A-C of the contested patent only give the initial weight amounts of a specific combination of silanated barium aluminosilicate as structural filler (SP-345), and of two different fumed silica together as a microfiller combination (silanated OX 50 fumed silica of average particle size of 0.04 um and TS-530 hydrophobic fumed silica of average particle size of 0.02 um).\n\nThus, apart from the specific combination of all examples, the skilled person does not have any general information as to the initial weight amounts or initial volume amounts of each individual component of the filler to be used to obtain the final claimed composite with its volume amounts. In view of the broad definition of the claimed invention, this amounts as such already to a necessary experimentation and an undue burden for the skilled person.\n\n1.3 The description of the contested patent is also silent about how to possibly convert the composition from amounts defined in weight percent to the claimed volume percent and/or to the amounts in weight of components to be used initially to obtain the claimed volume percent.\n\nTables 3 and 4 give the amounts of the components of several formulations in weight percent and the total filler amount (load) in weight and volume percent, with a conversion factor between the weight and the volume varying between 1.3 and 1.5. It appears thus from said examples that the conversion factor is  dependant on the combination in quality and amounts of structural filler, microfiller(s) and resin chosen and is not generalisable and predictable.\n\n1.4 The description does also not give any teaching as to which density has to be used (bulk or absolute density, apparent density, tapped density?) or the method, apparatus or calculation to be used to determine the volume of said powders or solids; moreover, no common general knowledge document has been cited as regards the method of calculation or conversion used in the field of dental composite.\n\nThe values of these different densities may be very different, as shown by D12 which gives an absolute density of about 2.2 g/cm**(3) and a tapped density of 130 g/L for Aerosil OX50.\n\nIn the present case, the choice of the type of density for the calculation is all the more important, since all the filler powders are first mixed together, and added later to the resin in a planetary mixer, where they are blended during several hours (see par. [0028]-[0031] of the specification). Hence, it is not credible that the use of the absolute density can provide a reliable conversion for the weight% used in the examples to the volume% used in the final composite of the claims. The measurement of the absolute density is made on an untapped volume of powder, while in the present case, the filler mixture and final composite is prepared by blending.\n\n1.5 Moreover, it is also obvious that the conversion to or the determination of the corresponding volume% of the claimed combination depends also on other factors than the density, such as inter alia the amounts or ratio of amounts of the different powders and the size, porosity or nature of the components used. It is also obvious that the degree of grinding of the structural filler, which is not specified in the claims, has an incidence on the final shape of the filler and on its surface adsorption properties, and thus on the final volume  percent.\n\nIn the present case, the filler mixture as claimed consists of a mixture of powders with very different sizes, namely a ground structural filler comprised with a size between 0.05 mym and 0.5 mym, with less than 50% by volume of particles above 0.5 mym, and a microfiller with a mean particle size of 0.04 mym or less; the amounts are very variable since said structural filler may be present in a broad range of 10 to 70% by volume, while the microfiller may be comprised in a range between 1 and 10% by volume. In view of the broad amount ratio and of the different particle sizes, it does not appear possible to know what amounts of the different fillers should be combined in order to arrive at the claimed volumes after their combination, especially in view of the interactive behavior of the structural ground filler and the microfiller(s).\n\nThe porosity and the morphology of the powders are also important factors and play a role, especially as regards the structural filler, since it is said that the resin is retained within the interstice of the structural filler, and the microfiller particles may be located within the interstices of the structural filler particles and displace them from the interstices (see par. [0014]-[0017] of the specification). It appears to be common sense that when adding load volumes of a resin and of two or three filler materials of different particle sizes, the component(s) with smaller particle size fills the interstices between the bigger particles of the other component(s), and this behavior has an incidence on the final total volume, as is acknowledged in par. [0035] or [0017] of the specification. Thus, the total volume of resin and fillers in the composite taken will be different from the arithmetic load volumes of the different individual filler or resin materials and is difficult to predict.\n\n1.6 Consequently, this amounts in an unpredictability as to the obtainable volume% and to a \"try and see\" method for obtaining the claimed volume% and/or for the preparation of the claimed composite.\n\nConsequently, the skilled person does not  know what initial amounts of the different fillers should be combined in order to arrive at the claimed volumes after their combination and the claimed invention is not sufficiently disclosed.\n\n1.7 The respondent argued that it was obvious that it was the absolute density which should be used, and school-age children knew that the relationship between the mass and the volume was governed by the density of the material. The respondent cited documents D10, D14 and D15 in support of its arguments.\n\nThe Board does not contest this argument as such, but considers that it may only apply to a powder of a unique product, and not to a blend of several powders different in size, granulometry and porosity since it does not take into account the interaction between the different powders and the possible wide variations for a same powder. This is emphasized and confirmed by document D15, cited by the respondent, which states the following on page 1090:\n\n\"Percentage of fillers by volume can be measured through direct and indirect methods. The direct method using the picnometric technique showed wide variations and high standard deviations [...]. The indirect technique uses a mathematical formulation including the percentage of fillers by weight and the density of the fillers. This procedure is not always simple, because if the percentage of fillers by weight is easy to measure, it is not the case with the density due to the wide variations of filler morphologies and molecular compositions\" (emphasis added by the Board).\n\nHence, D15 confirms that the knowledge of the density of the filler(s) is not sufficient for determining the volume corresponding to a specific weight only by calculation. In the present case, this is all the more crucial, since the structural filler must have an irregular shape to shelter the microfiller within its interstices.\n\nAccording to the opposition division, D10 shows the conversion of weight% into volume% for the specific examples A-C of Table 3 of the contested patent, using the densities of the respective ingredients known from D11-D13. However, the evidence fails to show that the density of the barium aluminoborosilicate glass used in the examples of the patent is known. In any case, this specific calculation does not provide further information and cannot constitute evidence of a generally applicable method for conversion.\n\nD14 is a statement which reminds that restorative composite may be described in terms of volume% and weight%; this statement merely repeats that it is a simple matter to convert from volume fraction to mass fraction and vice-versa, without providing further evidence or element as to the teaching of the contested patent.\n\n1.8 Consequently, the claimed invention is not sufficiently disclosed.\n\n2. Auxiliary requests 1-3\n\nIndependent claim 1 of all auxiliary requests comprises the same feature of volume percentage of the ground structural filler and the microfiller as claim 1 of the main request and all requests present therefore the same deficiency as to sufficiency of disclosure as the main request. The conclusion reached for the main request applies therefore mutatis mutandis to all auxiliary requests.",

This decision concerns the appeal filed by the patent proprietor (appellant) against the decision of the opposition division to revoke European patent No. 2 498 626.\n\nII. In the notice of opposition, the opponent (respondent) had requested that the patent be revoked in its entirety based on, inter alia, Article 100(c) EPC.\n\nIII.

Final requests\n\nThe appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be maintained on the basis of the main request or one of auxiliary requests 1 to 3, all requests as filed with the letter dated 29 November 2021.\n\nThe respondent requested that the appeal be dismissed.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The patent's disclosure relates to nutritional compositions comprising dietary fibres for promoting gut microbiota balance and health. The nutritional composition includes the combination of a fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS), a polysaccharide, which is acacia gum (AG), and inulin in specified relative amounts (paragraphs [0001] and [0016]).\n\n2. Main request - added subject-matter\n\n2.1 Claim 1 of the main request is directed to a nutritional composition comprising soluble fibre which is the combination of a FOS, AG and inulin. Further, it specifies amounts and ratios of the three components.\n\n2.2 The appellant's interpretation of claim 1 is that it is directed to a nutritional composition in which \"soluble fibre\" is only the combination of a FOS, AG, and inulin. In other words, claim 1 excludes any soluble fibre other than FOS, AG and inulin.\n\n2.3 The board accepts that claim 1 should be construed as proposed by the appellant.\n\n2.4 Thus the question is whether there is a basis in the application as filed for a nutritional composition in which the use of a soluble fibre other than FOS, AG and inulin is excluded.\n\n2.5 Claim 1 of the application as filed is directed to a composition comprising specified amounts and ratios of\n\n- a FOS;\n\n- a polysaccharide that is not partially hydrolysed guar gum (PHGG); and\n\n- inulin.\n\n2.6 This claim is the most generic disclosure of the invention of the application as filed. The claim does not require the polysaccharide to be a soluble fibre.\n\n2.7 In paragraph [0020] of the application as filed, FOS and inulin are described as soluble fibres.\n\nAccording to paragraph [0023] of the application as filed, the polysaccharide is preferably (\"typically\") an arabinogalactan, such as a gum. In an embodiment, it is AG. This gum is a highly branched, high molecular weight molecule that comprises galactose, arabinose, rhamnose and glucuronic acid. AG is slowly fermented compared with other soluble fibres.\n\n2.8 Thus, according to the application as filed, FOS, AG and inulin are characterised as being soluble fibres. The three components have the property of being soluble fibres, so their combination is a combination of soluble fibres as well.\n\n2.9 The skilled person would also derive from the application as filed that the nutritional composition includes FOS, AG and inulin in specified amounts and ratios. Support for this may be found for instance in paragraphs [0026] and [0106] and example 3.\n\n2.10 However, this does not mean that the application as filed has a direct and unambiguous disclosure or teaching to exclude any soluble fibre other than FOS, AG and inulin.\n\n2.11 The appellant referred to paragraph [0029] of the application as filed to support its argument that only FOS, AG and inulin were to be counted as part of the \"soluble fibre\". The paragraph reads:\n\n\"In yet another embodiment, the nutritional composition of the present disclosure further comprises at least one insoluble fiber, such as a soy fiber, an outer pea fiber or both. In an embodiment, at least one insoluble fiber is a combination of a soy fiber and an outer pea fiber. The ratio between the soluble fiber of the composition, i.e., FOS, arabinogalactans such as AG, and inulin, and the insoluble fiber is between 1.5:1 and 1:1.5, or between 1.25:1 and 1:1.25, or about 1:1 ...\"\n\n2.12 This paragraph discloses that the nutritional composition may include an insoluble fibre. The same optional feature is found in claim 7 of the application as filed. Furthermore, the paragraph discloses that the nutritional composition comprises the insoluble fibre in a defined ratio with the total of FOS, AG and inulin. These three fibres are described as the soluble fibre of the composition. A corresponding disclosure is found in claim 8 of the application as filed.\n\n2.13 The expression \"soluble fibre\" (in the original text: \"soluble fiber\") as a class or category of fibres comes into play when the content of the insoluble fibre has to be defined. In this context, several observations are made.\n\nFirstly, in the application as filed, \"soluble fibre\" is mostly used to characterise a property of a (dietary) fibre. This is already explained above, in points 2.7 and 2.8. Moreover, it is used as a class or category of (dietary) fibres, in particular if the nutritional composition also includes an insoluble fibre. Thus \"soluble fibre\" in the application as filed does not have an unambiguous meaning.\n\nSecondly, claim 1 of the main request does not call for an insoluble fibre. Thus the definition of soluble fibre given in this context, namely that of a class or category of dietary fibres, is not relevant.\n\nThirdly, both paragraph [0029] and claim 8 of the application as filed teach what is to be done if the nutritional composition includes an insoluble fibre: its content has to be in line with the content of the soluble fibre, which is FOS, AG and inulin. This disclosure underscores that a ratio of insoluble fibre and the total amount of FOS, AG and inulin has to be complied with. There is no teaching regarding other ingredients of the nutritional composition.\n\n2.14 Thus paragraph [0029] and claim 8 of the application as filed provide no support for the contention that the application as filed teaches excluding any soluble fibre other than FOS, AG and inulin.\n\n2.15 Rather, the opposite is true. The application as filed discloses that soluble fibre is preferably added to the nutritional composition. Therefore there is no teaching to (categorically) exclude it from the composition.\n\nIn particular, paragraph [0085] discloses a list of prebiotics that may be included in the nutritional composition. It is uncontested that the skilled person would regard many of the exemplified prebiotics (e.g. galactooligosaccharides) as soluble fibres.\n\nMoreover, paragraph [0027] discloses that the nutritional composition may comprise FOS, AG and inulin (in specified concentrations) and, additionally, partially hydrolysed guar gum (PHGG). This is a soluble fibre, as paragraph [0121] confirms, and a preferred ingredient of the nutritional composition (paragraphs [0028] and [0120]).\n\n2.16 It is true that claim 1 of the application as filed discloses the feature \"polysaccharide that is not partially hydrolysed guar gum (PHGG)\". This feature is retained in claim 1 of the main request.\n\nHowever, the feature does not mean that adding a further soluble fibre is restricted or even excluded. As explained above, adding PHGG is a preferred option disclosed in the application as filed. The feature \"polysaccharide that is not partially hydrolysed guar gum (PHGG)\" merely ensures that PHGG is not taken into account in the calculation of the amounts and ratios of FOS, polysaccharide and inulin.\n\n2.17 To conclude, the application as filed underscores that the nutritional composition, as a mandatory feature, requires specific amounts and ratios of three components, namely FOS, polysaccharide (which is preferably AG) and inulin. However, there is no direct and unambiguous disclosure to exclude any soluble fibre other than FOS, AG and inulin.\n\n2.18 It follows from this that claim 1 has no basis in the application as filed.\n\n2.19 Therefore the subject-matter of claim 1 involves added subject-matter (Article 123(2) EPC).\n\n3. Auxiliary requests 1 to 3 - added subject-matter\n\n3.1 Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 is based on claim 1 of the main request. The term \"which is the combination of\" in the latter is replaced by \"consisting of\".\n\nHowever, this amendment does not change the assessment of added subject-matter set out above. Therefore the same conclusion as for the main request applies.\n\n3.2 Claim 1 of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 is based on the higher-ranking requests, with the feature \"wherein the FOS and polysaccharide are present ... to 58:42\" being deleted.\n\nHowever, this amendment has no relevant impact on the assessment of added subject-matter set out above. For these claims too, the same conclusion as for the main request and auxiliary request 1 applies.\n\n3.3 Therefore the subject-matter of claim 1 of auxiliary requests 1 to 3 involves added subject-matter (Article 123(2) EPC).",

In its statement of grounds and at the oral proceedings before the board the appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be revoked.\n\nIII.

Article 113(2) EPC requires that the European Patent Office decides upon the European patent only in the text submitted to it, or agreed by the proprietor of the patent.\n\n2. Since in the present case the proprietor withdrew all pending claim requests during the oral proceedings before the board and declared its disapproval of any text for maintenance of the patent, there is no text of the patent which can be deemed to be approved by the patent proprietor.\n\n3.

Appeals were lodged by the patent proprietor\n\n(appellant I) and the opponent (appellant II) against the opposition division's interlocutory decision according to which European patent No. 2 129 392 (henceforth: the patent) as amended in the form of auxiliary request 3, and the invention to which it relates, were found to meet the requirements of\n\nthe EPC.\n\nII. With their statement of grounds of appeal, appellant I requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be maintained on the basis of the main request (patent as granted) or, alternatively, that the patent be maintained on the basis of one of the set of claims of auxiliary requests 1 to 5 submitted on 19 September 2016 or of the set of claims of auxiliary request 6, submitted on 6 September 2017. Oral proceedings were requested on an auxiliary basis.\n\nIII. With their statement of grounds of appeal, appellant II requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be revoked. Oral proceedings were requested on an auxiliary basis.\n\nIV. The board summoned oral proceedings and issued a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA 2007 setting out its preliminary opinion.\n\nV. In a letter dated 6 March 2020 appellant I declared \"that we no longer approve of the text of the opposed patent (EP 2 129 392), and that we do not approve of its text in any other version.\" They further stated that they understood that this would result in the patent being revoked and that their request for oral proceedings was withdrawn as well.\n\nVI. The parties were informed by fax dated 9 March 2020 that the oral proceedings were cancelled.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeals comply with Articles 106 to 108 and Rule 99 EPC and are therefore admissible.\n\n2. Pursuant to Article 113(2) EPC the EPO shall decide upon the European patent only in the text submitted to it, or agreed, by the proprietor of the patent.\n\n3. Such an agreement cannot be deemed to exist if the patent proprietor - as in the present case - expressly declares \"that we no longer approve of the text of the opposed patent (EP 2 129 392), and that we do not approve of its text in any other version\" (see\n\nsection V).\n\n4. There is therefore no text of the patent on the basis of which the board can consider the appeals. In these circumstances, the proceedings are to be terminated by a decision ordering revocation of the patent, without examination as to patentability (see decision T 73/84, OJ EPO 1985, 241; Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 9th Edition 2019, IV.D.2).\n\n5.

The appeals lodged by the patent proprietors and the opponents lie from the decision of the opposition division that European patent No. 2 575 762 in its amended form based on auxiliary request 3d fulfilled the requirements of the EPC.\n\nII. With their statement of grounds of appeal the patent proprietors requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be maintained as granted, or alternatively on the basis of one of the (re-filed) sets of claims of auxiliary requests 1 to 3 and description versions 3, 3b, 3c and 3d (identical to the requests dealt with in the decision under appeal) and auxiliary requests 4 to 9 (originally filed on 12 April 2018).\n\nIII. With their statements of grounds of appeal, the opponents requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be revoked.\n\nIV. All parties requested oral proceedings as an auxiliary measure.\n\nV. The board appointed oral proceedings and, in a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, provided its preliminary appreciation of some matters concerning the appeal.\n\nVI. In a letter dated 15 March 2022, the patent proprietors declared as follows:\n\n\"The Patent Proprietors herewith declare that they no longer approve the text in which the patent was granted, and that they no longer approve the amended text of the patent that is contained in any of the Requests that they have filed during the present opposition/appeal proceedings.\n\nAdditionally, the Patent Proprietors herewith withdraw their appeal.\"\n\nVIII. The board cancelled the oral proceedings.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeals of the opponents comply with Articles 106 to 108 and Rule 99 EPC and are admissible.\n\n2. Pursuant to Article 113(2) EPC the EPO shall examine, and decide upon, the European patent only in the text submitted to it, or agreed, by the proprietor of the patent.\n\n3. Such an agreement is deemed not to exist if the patent proprietors - as in the present case - expressly declare that they no longer approve the text in which the patent was granted, and that they no longer approve the amended text of the patent contained in any of the requests filed during the opposition/appeal proceedings (see section VI.).\n\n4. There is therefore no text of the patent on the basis of which the board can decide. In these circumstances, the patent is to be revoked, without assessing issues relating to patentability (see decision T 73/84, OJ EPO 1985, 241, followed by numerous decisions, see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 9th edition 2019, IV.D.2). The board has no reason to deviate from this approach of the boards of appeal.\n\n5. Revocation of the patent is also the main request of the opponents (see section III.). There are also no ancillary issues that need to be dealt with by the board in the present appeal case. The decision in the present appeal case can therefore be taken without holding oral proceedings.\n\n6. In view of the point in time of the withdrawal of the patent proprietors' appeal, the appeal fee is reimbursed in accordance with Rule 103(4)(a) EPC.",

Both parties to the proceedings (the patent proprietor and the opponent) lodged an appeal against the interlocutory decision of an opposition division according to which European patent No. 1 453 547 (\"the patent\") could be maintained in amended form.\n\nII. With their statement of grounds of appeal, appellant I (patent proprietor) submitted inter alia a main request and 29 auxiliary requests (auxiliary requests 1, 1A, and 2 to 28) and requested inter alia that the patent be maintained on the basis of the main request, or in the alternative on the basis of auxiliary requests 1, 1A or 2 to 28.\n\nIII. With their statement of grounds of appeal, appellant II (opponent) requested inter alia that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be revoked.\n\nIV. The board appointed oral proceedings and, in a subsequent communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA 2020, provided its preliminary appreciation of some matters concerning the appeal.\n\nV. In their letters dated 11 December 2023 and 14 December 2023, appellant I declared that they no longer approved the text of the patent as granted, and that they withdrew all auxiliary requests on file.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. Pursuant to the principle of party disposition established by Article 113(2) EPC, the EPO shall examine, and decide upon, the European patent only in the text submitted to it, or agreed, by the proprietor of the patent.\n\n2. In the present case, the patent proprietor no longer approves of the text in which the patent was granted. Furthermore, it has withdrawn all its pending requests (see letters dated 11 and 14 December 2023). There is thus no approved text on the basis of which the board could consider the appeals of the opponent and examine whether a ground for opposition prejudices the maintenance of the patent. It is also no longer possible to take a decision as to substance because the absence of an approved text precludes any substantive examination of the alleged impediments to patentability (T 186/84, OJ 1986, 79, point 5 of the Reasons;\n\nT 646/08, point 4 of the Reasons and T 2434/18, point 4 of the Reasons).\n\n3. According to the case law of the boards of appeal, in these circumstances the proceedings are to be terminated by a decision ordering revocation of the patent under Article 101 EPC without assessing issues relating to patentability since the patent proprietor no longer challenges the request for revocation of the opposed patent, and the patent cannot be maintained against the proprietor's will (see decision T 73/84, OJ EPO 1985, 241, and Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 10th edition 2022, III.B.3.3).\n\n4.

         "Sachverhalt und Anträge\n\nI. Die Beschwerde der Beschwerdeführerin (Einsprechende) richtet sich gegen die Entscheidung der Einspruchsabteilung, das Patent EP 2 448 552 gemäß Artikel 101(3)(a) EPÜ in geänderter Form aufrechtzuerhalten.\n\nII. Im Einspruchsverfahren war das Patent unter Artikel 100(a) in Verbindung mit Artikeln 54 und 56 EPÜ wegen mangelnder Neuheit und mangelnder erfinderischer Tätigkeit angegriffen worden. Dabei wurde unter anderem auf folgende Dokumente Bezug genommen:\n\nD1|WO 03/077856                                                                                  |\n\nD2|WO 2004/007520                                                                                |\n\nD4  |Chemistry and Reaction of Singlet Oxygen in Food, Min and Boff (2002), Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety, Vol. 1, S. 58-72|\n\nD6  |Citrus peel extract - A natural source of antioxidant, Rehmann (2006), Food Chemistry, Vol. 99, S. 450-454|\n\nD7   |Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Potentials of Essential Oils and Their Individual Volatile Constituents; A review, Edris (2007), Phytother.

In ihrer Entscheidung kam die Einspruchsabteilung zu dem Schluss, die Ansprüche des erteilten Patents und des ihr vorliegenden ersten Hilfsantrags seien nicht neu gegenüber D1. Die Ansprüche des zweiten Hilfsantrags seien neu und auch erfinderisch ausgehend von D4 als nächstem Stand der Technik.\n\nIV. In ihrer Beschwerdebegründung führte die Beschwerdeführerin aus, die in der aufrechterhaltenen Form des Patents beanspruchten Zusammensetzungen seien für den Fachmann ausgehend von D4 nahegelegt. Überdies seien sie auch ausgehend von D2 nahegelegt, das als nächster Stand der Technik geeigneter sei als D4. Jedenfalls erfüllten die Ansprüche nicht die Voraussetzungen von Artikel 56 EPÜ. Das Patent sei daher zu widerrufen.\n\nV. In ihrer Beschwerdeerwiderung argumentierte die Beschwerdegegnerin im Wesentlichen, die Argumente der Einspruchsabteilung seien korrekt. D4 sei der nächste Stand der Technik. Die beanspruchten Zusammensetzungen seien ausgehend von D4 für den Fachmann nicht nahegelegt.\n\nVI. In einer Mitteilung gemäß Regel 100(2) EPÜ vom 27. August 2020  teilte die Kammer den Parteien ihre vorläufige Auffassung der Sach- und Rechtslage mit. Sie führte aus, ihrer Ansicht nach sei D1 das Dokument, das den nächsten Stand der Technik darstelle. Ausgehend von D1 seien die beanspruchten Zusammensetzungen für den Fachmann nicht nahegelegt.\n\nVII. Die Parteien reichten keine weiteren inhaltlichen Eingaben ein. Mit Schreiben vom 15. Dezember 2020 zog die Beschwerdeführerin ihren in der Beschwerdebegründung gestellten Antrag auf mündliche Verhandlung zurück und beantragte, im schriftlichen Verfahren zu verbleiben.\n\nVIII. Die Beschwerdeführerin beantragt, die angefochtene Entscheidung aufzuheben und das Patent zu widerrufen.\n\nDie Beschwerdegegnerin (Patentinhaberin) beantragt, die Beschwerde zurückzuweisen. Hilfsweise beantragt sie mündliche Verhandlung.\n\nIX. Anspruch 1 des dieser Entscheidung zugrundeliegenden Antrags lautet:\n\nKosmetische oder dermatologische Zubereitung umfassend hydrolisiertes Milchprotein, ein oder mehrere Citrusöle und zusätzlich ein oder mehrere Parfumöle, die die Citrusöle umfassen, dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass der Anteil an Citrusölen im Bereich von 0,01 bis 0,1 Gew.%, bezogen auf die Gesamtmasse der Zubereitung, beträgt, die Citrusöle bis zu einem Anteil bis zu 30 Gew.%, bezogen auf die Gesamtmasse an Parfumöl, enthalten sind und als Citrusöle Orangenöl und Bergamotöl gewählt werden.",
         "Entscheidungsgründe\n\n1. Die Beschwerde ist zulässig.\n\n2. Hilfsweiser Antrag auf mündliche Verhandlung wurde nur von der Beschwerdegegnerin gestellt. Da, wie noch auszuführen ist, ihrem höherrangigen Antrag auf Zurückweisung der Beschwerde stattgegeben wird, ist eine Entscheidung im schriftlichen Verfahren statthaft.\n\n3. Erfinderische Tätigkeit (Artikel 56 EPÜ)\n\n3.1 Das Patent beansprucht kosmetische oder dermatologische Zubereitungen, die hydrolysiertes Milchprotein und zusätzlich Zitrusöle enthalten. Der der Entscheidung zugrundeliegende unabhängige Anspruch schränkt die Zitrusöle auf Orangenöl und/oder Bergamotteöl in einem bestimmten Mengenanteil ein.\n\nEinziger strittiger Punkt ist die Frage, ob diese Zusammensetzungen aus dem Stand der Technik für einen Fachmann nahegelegt waren.\n\n3.2 Die Beschwerdeführerin argumentiert im Wesentlichen wie folgt:\n\nIn der angefochtenen Entscheidung bilde D4 den nächsten Stand der Technik. In D4 werden Milchproteine durch Ascorbinsäure stabilisiert. Vorliegend werde die Stabilisierung durch Zitrusöle erreicht.\n\nDas Patent enthalte keinerlei Daten bezüglich der stabilisierenden Wirkung der Zitrusöle auf die Milchproteine. Die Wirkung wurde in der Entscheidung als glaubhaft angesehen, da aus dem Stand der Technik die antioxidative Wirkung der Zitrusöle allgemein bekannt sei. Dies sei widersprüchlich, denn wenn diese Wirkung bekannt gewesen sei, könnten die Ansprüche nicht auf erfinderischer Tätigkeit beruhen.\n\nEin Effekt einer Auswahl der beanspruchten Zitrusöle in den beanspruchten Konzentrationsbereichen sei nicht gezeigt worden, obwohl dies bei Auswahlerfindungen nötig sei. Dazu wurde auf die Richtlinien für die Prüfung verwiesen.\n\nEin Fachmann hätte daher ausgehend von D4 Zitrusöle als alternative Antioxidantien zur Stabilisierung von Milchproteinen verwendet.\n\nIm übrigen sei D2 ein besser geeigneter Ausgangspunkt für die Beurteilung der erfinderischen Tätigkeit.\n\n3.3 Die Beschwerdegegnerin argumentiert im Wesentlichen, die Argumente der Einspruchsabteilung seien korrekt. D4 sei der nächste Stand der Technik. Ausgehend von D4 sei die Stabilisierung von Milchproteinen durch Bergamotte- und Orangenöl in der beanspruchten Konzentration nicht naheliegend gewesen.\n\n3.4 Die Kammer hält die Argumente der Beschwerdeführerin nicht für überzeugend, und zwar aus den folgenden Gründen:\n\n3.4.1 Das Patent beansprucht kosmetische oder dermatologische Zubereitungen, die hydrolysiertes Milchprotein und zusätzlich Zitrusöle enthalten. Der der Entscheidung zugrundeliegende unabhängige Anspruch schränkt die Zitrusöle auf Orangenöl und/oder Bergamotteöl in einem bestimmten Mengenanteil ein.\n\n3.4.2 Das Patent beschäftigt sich mit dem Problem, kosmetische Zubereitungen mit Milchproteinen zur Verfügung zu stellen, die keine Stabilitätsprobleme aufweisen und insbesondere hinsichtlich ihrer olfaktorischen Gestaltung unbeeinflusst bleiben, siehe Absatz [0007] des Patents. Die Instabilität der hydrolisierten Milchproteine führt nämlich zu Geruchsbeeinträchtigungen (siehe Absatz [0006] des Patents).\n\n3.4.3 Als nächster Stand der Technik wurden von den Parteien D2 und D4 genannt; die Einspruchsabteilung ging in ihrer Entscheidung von D4 aus. Sie begründete das damit, dass D4 die Oxidation von Milch und den damit verbundenen schlechten Geruch zum Thema hat, und vorschlägt, dies durch Zugaben von Antioxidantien zu verhindern.\n\n3.4.4 Die Kammer ist allerdings der Ansicht, dass als nächster Stand der Technik von den angeführten Dokumenten nur D1 in Frage kommt, und zwar aus den folgenden Gründen:\n\nD1 ist ein Dokument, das auf dem Gebiet der beanspruchten Erfindung liegt, denn es beschreibt kosmetische Zubereitungen, die hydrolysierte Milchproteine enthalten. Dadurch wird die Haut befeuchtet. Zusätzlich sind ätherische Öle enthalten, beispielsweise Zitrusöle, die der Aromatherapie dienen (siehe etwa Seite 3, Zeilen 15-20).\n\nEin Fachmann, der sich zum Ziel setzt, bestimmte hydrolysierte Milchproteine enthaltende kosmetische Zubereitungen herzustellen, würde zunächst von einem Dokument ausgehen, das solche Zubereitungen zum Inhalt hat. Andernfalls würde er ja gar nicht auf die im Patent behandelte Problematik aufmerksam werden.\n\nD2 beschäftigt sich weder mit kosmetischen Zubereitungen, noch mit Milch, noch mit Zitrusölen und kommt daher als nächster Stand der Technik nicht in Frage.\n\nD4 ist ein Übersichtsartikel über den Einfluss von Singulett-Sauerstoff auf die Stabilität von Lebensmitteln. In diesem Dokument wird auch auf die Stabilität von Milch unter Licht-und Sauerstoffeinfluss Bezug genommen (Seite 66) und es wird erklärt, auf welche Weise der saure Geschmack der Milch entsteht. Am Schluss des Abschnitts über Milch wird gefolgert, dass der Zusatz von Ascorbinsäure als Singulett-Sauerstoff-Quencher das Sauerwerden der Milch verhindern kann. Ein solches Dokument mag als sekundäres Dokument bei der Diskussion der erfinderischen Tätigkeit eine Rolle spielen. Allerdings würde der Fachmann nicht von D4 ausgehen, wenn er stabilisierte kosmetische Zusammensetzungen herstellen möchte. Kosmetische oder dermatologische Zusammensetzungen sind in D4 nicht erwähnt.\n\n3.4.5 Ausgehend von D1 stellte sich für den Fachmann die in Absatz [0007] des Patents erwähnte Aufgabe, kosmetische Zusammensetzungen herzustellen, die keine Stabilitätsprobleme aufweisen. Insbesondere soll der Abbau des Milchproteins verhindert werden.\n\nDie beanspruchte Lösung der Aufgabe besteht darin, Zusammensetzungen zu verwenden, in denen Bergamotteöl oder Orangenöl in einem bestimmten Anteil enthalten sind.\n\n3.4.6 Die Beschwerdeführerin bestreitet nicht, dass durch die Zugabe der Öle wie beansprucht eine solche Stabilisierung erreicht werden kann. Auch die Kammer hegt solche Zweifel nicht. Obwohl das Patent keine Daten enthält, gilt die gestellte Aufgabe daher als gelöst.\n\n3.4.7 Die Beschwerdeführerin ist allerdings der Ansicht, die beanspruchte Lösung sei für den Fachmann naheliegend, und beruft sich dabei auf D1, D2, D4 und D6-D9.\n\n3.4.8 Die Kammer kommt zu einem anderen Schluss.\n\nD1 selbst beschäftigt sich nicht mit der Stabilisierung des Milchproteins. Stabilitätserwägungen in D1 beziehen sich auf die Stabilität der Emulsionen, siehe etwa Seite 8 Zeile 6ff. Aus D1 erhält der Fachmann daher keinen Hinweis, zur Vermeidung von Stabilitäts- und Geruchsproblemen Bergamotte- oder Orangenöl in den beanspruchten Konzentrationen hinzuzufügen. Diese zwei Inhaltsstoffe werden zwar erwähnt (Seite 6), allerdings in einer langen Liste möglicher ätherischer Öle, die bei weitem nicht auf Zitrusöle beschränkt ist.\n\nKeines der zitierten Dokumente offenbart, dass Zitrusöle zur Stabilisierung von Milchproteinen geeignet sind. In den zitierten Dokumenten ist ja nicht einmal offenbart, dass hydrolysierte Milchproteine in kosmetischen Zubereitungen überhaupt durch Antioxidantien stabilisiert werden können oder müssen.\n\nD4 offenbart, dass der \"Lichtgeschmack\" von Milch durch Singulett-Sauerstoff-Oxidation von Methionin entsteht, was durch Ascorbinsäure verhindert werden kann (siehe letzter Absatz auf Seite 66). Inwieweit diese Erkenntnis auf kosmetische Zubereitungen anwendbar ist, die hydrolysierte Milchproteine enthalten, bleibt unerwähnt, ebenso eventuelle Eigenschaften von Orangen- und Bergamotteöl als Singulett-Sauerstoff-Quencher.\n\nD6-D9 beschreiben allgemein antioxidative Eigenschaften verschiedener Zitrusöle. Eine Eigenschaft als Singulett-Sauerstoff-Quencher ist nicht beschrieben. In den Fällen, in denen der antioxidative Mechanismus erwähnt wird (D8, Seite 77, zweite Spalte, D9 Seite 3391, erste Spalte), geht es um Eigenschaften als Radikalfänger, nicht um Singulett-Sauerstoff. Ein Fachmann hatte keinen Anlass, dieses Wissen zur Stabilisierung hydrolysierter Milchproteine in kosmetischen Zubereitungen zu verwenden, umso weniger mittels der beiden spezifisch beanspruchten Öle in den beanspruchten Konzentrationsbereichen.\n\nD2 hilft dem Fachmann ebenso wenig weiter, denn dort werden ja weder Milchproteine noch Zitrusöle beschrieben.\n\n3.4.9 Die Ausführungen der Beschwerdeführerin in Bezug auf Auswahlerfindungen gehen am Kern der Sache vorbei. Es handelt sich vorliegend nicht um eine Auswahlerfindung, in der ein im Grunde bekannter Effekt in besonderer Weise durch Vergleichsversuche nachgewiesen werden müsste. Weder im nächsten Stand der Technik (D1) noch in einem anderen Dokument ist ein stabilisierender Effekt von Orangen- oder Bergamotte-Öl auf hydrolysierte Milchproteine beschrieben.\n\nEs ist auch kein Widerspruch, wie von der Beschwerdeführerin behauptet, einerseits den behaupteten stabilisierenden Effekt als gegeben hinzunehmen, und andererseits eine Verwendung der beanspruchten Zitrusöle als erfinderisch anzusehen. Selbst wenn ein antioxidativer Effekt der Zitrusöle in anderen Zusammenhängen bekannt war, so besteht die erfinderische Leistung dennoch darin, ihn zur Vermeidung von Geruchsveränderungen in kosmetischen Zubereitungen, die hydrolysierte Milchproteine enthalten, zu nutzen. Dies ist aus dem Stand der Technik nicht nahegelegt.\n\n3.5 Ausgehend von D1 als nächstem Stand der Technik wurde daher das oben definierte technische Problem auf eine für den Fachmann nicht naheliegende Weise gelöst. Erfinderische Tätigkeit ist gegeben.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The appellant (opponent) lodged an appeal against the interlocutory decision of the opposition division on the maintenance of European patent No. 3 047 843 in the form of the main request then pending.\n\nII. Notice of opposition had been filed on grounds including lack of inventive step (Article 100(a) EPC).\n\nIII. The following document is relevant to the present decision:\n\nD1:    EP 2 087 878 A1\n\nIV. The main request before the opposition division is also the respondent's (patent proprietor's) main request in appeal. Claim 1 reads as follows:\n\n\"A first agent for oxidation hair dye containing a carbonate, wherein an upper limit of the content of the carbonate in the first agent is 10% by mass or less, the first agent comprising\n\n(A) at least one selected from resorcin and salts thereof, a compounding amount of the component (A) being 0.03 to 0.1% by mass,\n\n(B) at least one coupler selected from m-aminophenol, 5-amino-o-cresol, and alpha-naphthol, and\n\n(C) 0.01 to 0.45% by mass of at least one dye intermediate selected from p-phenylenediamine, toluene-2,5-diamine, p-aminophenol, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-p-phenylenediamine and salts thereof,\n\na mass ratio of a content of the component (B) to a content of the component (A) in the first agent for oxidation hair dye being 0.6 to 10.\"\n\nV. The opposition division concluded that D1 was a suitable starting point for examining inventive step. The composition in Table 1 of D1 disclosed an agent with a carbonate proportion over the threshold set by claim 1. The problem underlying the claimed invention was the stabilisation of the first agent for oxidation hair dyes and in particular of coupler (B). No indication were found in the prior art which could have led the skilled person to modify the compositions in the manner proposed by claim 1 to solve that problem. The claimed subject-matter was thus inventive.\n\nVI. With the reply to the grounds of appeal, the respondent filed three auxiliary requests. Claim 1 of the first auxiliary request is identical to claim 1 of the main request. Claim 1 of the second auxiliary request limits the required carbonate to twelve different chemicals, and claim 1 of the third auxiliary request requires the first agent for oxidation hair dye to contain ammonium hydrogencarbonate.\n\nVII. The appellant argued on inventive step as follows. If the claimed agent were to be novel over that of D1, it would be by virtue of the proportion of carbonate. For want of a comparison reflecting the effect of the difference, the sole problem which could be considered solved was that of providing an alternative. The claimed solution, characterised by a slightly lower proportion of carbonate, would have been obvious for a skilled person looking for an alternative.\n\nVIII. The respondent argued that paragraph [0074] of the patent showed that the claimed compositions were stable at 45ºC for one month. The claimed agent thus provided an unexpected effect and the burden of proving the contrary was on the appellant. The claimed subject-matter was thus inventive.\n\nIX. The board informed the parties in a communication dated 17 November 2023 of its preliminary view that starting from D1 the problem of providing a first agent for oxidation hair dye having increased stability, in particular of the coupler component (B), was not credibly solved. The examples of the patent either contained 4% or no carbonate at all. No comparison showed the effect of the carbonate proportion, let alone with respect to the proportion of 10.5% disclosed in D1. Thus the problem underlying the invention should be reformulated in a less ambitious manner.\n\nX. The respondent replied to the board's communication by withdrawing its request for oral proceedings, which had been summoned. The oral proceedings were cancelled.\n\nXI. The parties' final requests were as follows:\n\nThe appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent revoked.\n\nThe respondent requested that the appeal be dismissed, or that the patent be maintained with the claims of the first to third auxiliary requests as filed with the reply to the grounds of appeal.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeal is admissible.\n\n2. Claim 1 of the main request relates to a first agent for oxidation hair dye containing a carbonate. The upper limit of the carbonate proportion is 10% by mass. The agent further contains defined proportions of resorcin, a coupler and a dye.\n\n3. Closest prior art - D1\n\nIt was undisputed that D1 was a suitable starting point for examining inventive step, or that the first agent blend component disclosed in Table 1 of D1 contained 10.5% by mass of ammonium hydrogencarbonate, which was the carbonate in the examples of the claimed invention, 0.07% resorcin, 0.07% of the couplers required by claim 1 and 0.18% toluene-2,5-diamine.\n\nIn the following the board assumes, for the benefit of the respondent, that the first agent for oxidation hair dye of claim 1 differs from that in D1 by virtue of the carbonate proportion i.e. 10% by mass or less, instead of 10.5%. The question whether this feature can impart novelty can be left unanswered.\n\n4. Problem underlying the claimed invention.\n\nThe opposition division formulated the problem as to provide a first agent for oxidation hair dye having increased stability, in particular of the coupler component (B), see point 41 of the appealed decision. The respondent did not explicitly formulate the problem underlying the claimed invention in appeal and referred in general to \"stabilisation effects\".\n\n5. Solution\n\nThe claimed solution is the agent of claim 1, which is characterised by a proportion of carbonate of 10% by mass or less.\n\n6. Success\n\n6.1 The respondent argued that the change in colour tone was an indicator of the composition stability.\n\n6.2 The examples of the patent either contain 4% carbonate (examples 1 to 11, comparative examples 1 to 5 and 7) or lacked carbonate (comparative example 6). The results demonstrate that the absence of carbonate is detrimental (see also paragraph [0017] of the patent).\n\nThere is however no evidence on file which could provide a comparison arising from the feature assumed to distinguish the claimed invention from the composition in Table 1 of D1, namely a proportion of carbonate of less than 10%.\n\nThe problem formulated by the opposition division has thus not been credibly solved.\n\n6.3 The respondent argued that it was for the appellant to prove that the alleged effect was not achieved. However, each party bears the burden of proving the facts it alleges. It is the respondent's argument that an improvement has been achieved and the burden of proof is on the respondent to show that the claimed subject-matter leads to any advantageous effect mentioned in the patent.\n\n6.4 The respondent also relied on paragraph [0074] which showed that the claimed compositions were stable at 45ºC for one month. However, none of the compositions tested reflect those of the prior art. It cannot be concluded that an improvement in terms of stability over the composition in D1 has been achieved.\n\n7. Reformulation of the technical problem\n\nIn accordance with the case law (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 10th Ed. 2022, I.D.4.3.1) alleged but unsupported advantages cannot be taken into consideration in determining the problem underlying the invention. As the alleged improvement in terms of stability of the dyeing composition lacks the necessary experimental support, the problem underlying the claimed invention needs to be formulated in a less ambitious manner.\n\nIn view of the available data, the problem is reformulated as to provide an alternative first agent for oxidation hair dye. In view of the examples in the patent, this problem has been credibly solved by the claimed agent.\n\n8. Obviousness\n\nThe closest prior art discloses a composition containing 10.5% by mass of carbonate. Seeking an alternative, a skilled person would have considered minor modifications in the components proportions and would thus have arrived at the claimed agent having 10% mass or less of carbonate without an inventive step.\n\nThe claimed first agent for oxidation hair dye is thus not inventive (Article 56 EPC) and the respondent's main request not allowable.\n\n9. Auxiliary requests\n\nClaim 1 of the first auxiliary request is identical to claim 1 of the main request. The objection in the previous points thus applies analogously.\n\nClaim 1 of the second and third auxiliary requests include ammonium hydrogencarbonate as carbonate. Ammonium hydrogencarbonate is the carbonate in the composition of the closest prior art. As claim 1 of these requests do not include any feature further distinguishing the claimed agent from that in D1, the objections with respect of the main request apply analogously.\n\nTherefore, none of the auxiliary requests is allowable and the patent must be revoked.",

The opposition division took the interlocutory decision that, on the basis of the main request filed during the oral proceedings, the patent met the requirements of the EPC.\n\nClaim 1 of this main request read as follows:\n\n\"A tooth whitening product, comprising:\n\na) a strip of material sized to cover the front surface of one or more teeth and soft tissue adjacent the front surface of the one or more teeth;\n\nb) a thin layer of a tooth whitening composition disposed on said strip of material, wherein the thickness of said thin layer is between 0.008 mm and less than 0.3 mm and said whitening composition comprises a peroxide active having a concentration between greater than 7.5% and less than 20% by weight of said tooth whitening composition; and\n\nsaid tooth whitening composition has a peroxide density between greater than 0.5 mg/cm**(2) and less than 1.3 mg/cm**(2).\"\n\nIV. The opposition division decided in particular that the main request fulfilled the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC for the following reasons.\n\nClaims 8 and 9 as filed taught that a thickness range of up to 0.3 mm and greater than 0.008 mm was preferred. As regards the peroxide density, the application as filed stated that the upper limit was 1.3 mg/cm**(2), and disclosed the lower limit of 0.5 mg/cm**(2) as the most restricted value. Likewise, the application as filed taught that a peroxide concentration of more than 7.5 % w/w must be provided, and disclosed 20% as the most restricted upper limit. Additionally, the claimed ranges for peroxide density and peroxide concentration were derivable from the data points \"7.5% in combination with 1.3. mg/cm**(2)\", and \"20% in combination with 0.5 mg/cm**(2)\" provided in figure 9 and on page 9 of the application as filed.\n\nV. The opponent (appellant) lodged an appeal against the interlocutory decision of the opposition division.\n\nVI. With its reply to the grounds of appeal, the patent proprietor (respondent) defended its case on the basis of the main request upheld by the opposition division, and on the basis of auxiliary requests 1-3 filed with this reply.\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 1 differed from claim 1 of the main request in that the lower limit of the peroxide concentration was 8%.\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 2 differed from claim 1 of the main request by the feature that the strip of material be substantially flat.\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 3 combined both amendments.\n\nVII. The appellant's arguments regarding added subject-matter can be summarised as follows:\n\nClaim 1 of the main request defined three numerical ranges in combination, namely a layer thickness between 0.008 mm and less than 0.3 mm, a peroxide concentration between greater than 7.5 % and less than 20%, and a peroxide density between greater than 0.5 mg/cm**(2) and less than 1.3 mg/cm**(2). The application as filed only disclosed open ranges, and did not provide support for the combination of the specific lower and upper thresholds for each range recited in claim 1, let alone for the specific combination of these ranges. The paragraph bridging pages 9 and 10 recited several upper and lower values for the peroxide concentration and density, without identifying any of these values as preferred. Figure 9 and the passages of the description referring to it did not disclose the claimed ranges or their combination either. These parts of the application as filed were silent about the thickness of the thin layer. The quadrants I and II of figure 9 did not support the claimed ranges for the peroxide density and concentration either.\n\nConsequently, claim 1 of the main request contravened Article 123(2) EPC. For the same reasons, none of auxiliary requests 1-3 met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.\n\nVIII. The respondent's arguments regarding added subject-matter can be summarised as follows:\n\nClaim 1 of the main request was based on claim 1 as filed. As regards the thickness of the thin layer, the upper limit of 0.3 mm was presented in the application as filed as the first option on page 11, line 10, and as the sole upper limit in claim 8, and the lower limit of 0.008 mm found basis in claim 9. The upper limit in the peroxide concentration was the narrowest in the range of values on page 10, line 2 and hence the most preferred upper limit. The lower limit of the peroxide density was the most preferred lower limit on page 9, antepenultimate line. It could also be seen from figure 9, that this value defined a preferred lower cut-off value for the peroxide density.\n\nIt was apparent from the context of the application as filed that the thickness of the layer, the peroxide concentration and the peroxide density were features which were intended to be read together. The upper and lower limits of the ranges of each integer were also intended to be read together. Only the broadest or most preferred values have been used. Hence the claimed subject-matter did not result from selections from multiple lists and complied with Article 123(2) EPC.\n\nIX. The appellant requests that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be revoked.\n\nX. The respondent requests that the appeal be dismissed and the patent be maintained on the basis of the claims held allowable by the opposition division (main request), or that the patent be maintained on the basis of one of auxiliary requests 1-3 filed with the reply to the grounds of appeal.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. Main request, Article 123(2) EPC\n\n1.1 Claim 1 of the main request relates to a tooth whitening product, comprising a strip of material and a thin layer of a peroxide-containing tooth whitening composition disposed thereon, characterised in particular by the following features:\n\n- the thickness of the thin layer is between 0.008 mm and less than 0.3 mm,\n\n- the peroxide concentration is between greater than 7.5% and less than 20% by weight of the tooth whitening composition, and\n\n- the peroxide density is between greater than 0.5 mg/cm**(2) and less than 1.3 mg/cm**(2).\n\n1.2 Under Article 123(2) EPC, amendments can only be made within the limits of what a skilled person would derive directly and unambiguously, using common general knowledge, from the whole of the application as filed (following the \"gold standard\" set out in G 2/10). In the present case, the question is not only whether the application as filed discloses each of the claimed ranges for the layer thickness, peroxide concentration and peroxide density, but also whether the application as filed contains a pointer to their combination.\n\n1.3 The claimed range for the layer thickness (\"between 0.008 mm and less than 0.3 mm\") is not shown as such in the application as filed. It derives from a combination of the upper limit shown in dependent claim 8 (less than about 0.3 mm) and the lower limit of the range shown in claim 9 (between about 0.008 mm and about 0.1 mm) of the application as filed. Although this combination of endpoints is not in itself contestable under Article 123(2) EPC, it must be seen as a (first) selection from the list of possible ranges deriving from combinations of claims 8 and 9, or from the lists of upper and lower limits on page 11 (first full paragraph). Contrary to the opposition division's finding (see paragraph 2.2 of the decision), the application as filed does not identify the thickness range 0.008-0.3 mm as being preferred.\n\n1.4 The claimed range for the peroxide concentration combines the general lower limit of claim 1 as filed (greater than about 7.5 % by weight) with one of the upper limits shown in the paragraph bridging pages 9 and 10 (less than about 20%). This paragraph discloses peroxide concentrations \"greater than about 7.5%, or greater than about 8%, or greater than about 10%, or greater than about 12%, or greater than about 16%, or greater than about 20 %, and/or less than about 40%, or less than about 35%, or less than about 30%, or less than about 20%\". According to the respondent, the upper limit of less than 20% is the narrowest in the range of values shown in this paragraph, and hence the most preferred. The Board rather shares the appellant's view that no such preference can be inferred from this paragraph. This passage of the application as filed does not point to concentrations below 20% any more than it points to concentrations above 20%.\n\n1.5 Likewise, the claimed range for the peroxide density combines the general upper limit of claim 1 as filed (less than about 1.3 mg/cm**(2)) with one of the lower limits shown in the same paragraph bridging pages 9 and 10. According to this paragraph, the peroxide density is \"less than about 1.2 mg/cm**(2), or less than about 1.1 mg/cm**(2), or less than about 1 mg/cm**(2), or less than about 0.75 mg/cm**(2), or less than about 0.5 mg/cm**(2), and/or greater than about 0.01 mg/cm**(2) or greater than about 0.1 mg/cm**(2), or greater than about 0.25 mg/cm**(2), or greater than about 0.5 mg/cm**(2)\". Here again, no preference for densities greater than 0.5 mg/cm**(2) over e.g. densities below this value can be derived.\n\n1.6 The decision under appeal additionally relies on figure 9 and page 9. In particular, the first full paragraph on page 9 mentions an embodiment characterised by a peroxide concentration of 20% and a peroxide density of 0.5 mg/cm**(2), and the second paragraph on the same page points to peroxide densities (with respect to the tolerability lines) in the upper two quadrants I and II of figure 9.\n\nHowever, as noted by the appellant, these passages and figure do not mention any layer thickness. Furthermore, the claimed concentration and density ranges do not cover the embodiment 20% / 0.5 mg/cm**(2), since these values are excluded by the expressions \"less than 20%\" and \"greater than 0.5 mg/cm**(2)\". These claimed ranges do not correspond to the upper two quadrants I and II of figure 9 either, since they cover values in quadrant III.\n\n1.7 In conclusion, the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request results from the combination of features selected from several lists. The application as filed does not contain any pointer to the claimed combination.\n\nAccordingly, the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC are not met.\n\n2. Auxiliary requests 1-3, Article 123(2) EPC\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 2 is characterised by the same ranges for the layer thickness, peroxide concentration and peroxide density as claim 1 of the main request. As to claim 1 of each of auxiliary requests 1 and 3, the lower limit for the peroxide concentration is amended to 8%, which involves a further combination with the lower limit of the range of claim 2 in the application as filed. Thus, as for the main request, claim 1 of each of auxiliary requests 1-3 involves selections within multiple lists of alternative features. In the absence of any pointer to these particular combinations, the criteria of Article 123(2) EPC are not fulfilled.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. This decision concerns the appeals filed by opponents 1 and 2 (appellants 1 and 2) against the opposition division's interlocutory decision (decision under appeal), according to which European patent No. 2 487 163 (patent) in amended form meets the requirements of the EPC.\n\nThe patent originates from European patent application No. 12 167 591.2, which is a divisional application of European patent application No. 08 743 531.9.\n\nII. In preparation for the oral proceedings, scheduled at the parties' request, the board issued a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA 2020.\n\nIII. On 5 July 2022, oral proceedings were held before the board in the presence of all the parties. At the end of the oral proceedings, the chair announced the order of the present decision.\n\nIV. The parties' final requests relevant to this decision were as follows:\n\n- Appellants 1 and 2 requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be revoked in its entirety.\n\n- The patent proprietor (respondent) requested that the appeals be dismissed, implying that the patent be maintained in amended form as held allowable in the decision under appeal (main request).\n\nV. The parties' appeal cases relevant to the present decision can be summarised as follows:\n\nAppellants 1 and 2\n\n- The claimed subject-matter of the main request was the result of a double selection from the parent application as filed without there being any pointer to this effect. This view was supported by decisions T 1255/18 and T 3139/19. The main request therefore did not meet the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC.\n\nRespondent\n\n- Summaries of the respondent's arguments relating to the main request are contained in the reasons for this decision.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\nMain request\n\n1. The set of claims of the main request consists of the following claim (in the following \"claim 1\"):\n\n\"A pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula IIBb\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, and/or solvate thereof, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and atazanavir.\"\n\nThe compound whose structure is shown in claim 1 is example S of the parent application as filed. In agreement with the parties, it is referred to as cobicistat hereinafter. Thus claim 1 relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising, inter alia, cobicistat and atazanavir.\n\n2. Amendments (Article 76(1) EPC)\n\n2.1 In line with the parties, the board refers to the published version (WO 2008/103949 A1) for the disclosure of the parent application as filed.\n\n2.2 The respondent acknowledged that atazanavir is the result of a selection from the parent application as filed. The only dispute between the parties concerned the question of whether or not cobicistat involves a further selection.\n\n2.2.1 As regards cobicistat, the following parts of the parent application as filed are relevant (it should be recalled that example S is cobicistat):\n\n(a) page 217, line 1 to page 393, line 5, with syntheses of compounds according to the invention; four methods of synthesis for example S are disclosed on pages 251 to 259\n\n(b) page 194, lines 21 ff.; this passage reads:\n\n\"For example, such combinations can comprise Example P, S, or X, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, and/or ester thereof in combination with two or three additional therapeutic agents selected from the group consisting of [...]\"\n\n(c) claims 19 to 21; these claims read as follows:\n\n\"19.  A compound which is:\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester,\n\nand/or solvate thereof.\n\n20.  A compound which is\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester,\n\nand/or solvate thereof.\n\n21.  A compound which is\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester,\n\nand/or solvate thereof.\"\n\nEach of these claims is an independent claim. They relate to examples P (claim 19), S (claim 20) and X (claim 21).\n\n(d) page 401, lines 3 to 7; this passage reads:\n\n\"Experimental data based on representative Examples P, S, and T have a CYP450 3A4 inhibition activity in a range represented by an IC50 from about 80-150 nM, a CYP450 2C9 inhibition activity in a range represented by an IC50 from about 1000-10,000 nM, and a protease inhibition activity in a range represented by HIV EC50 greater than about 30,000 nM.\"\n\n2.2.2 Part (a) does not present cobicistat as preferred to the other examples of the parent application as filed.\n\nIn parts (b) and (d), cobicistat is presented at the same level of preference as two other examples, namely examples P and X and examples P and T, respectively.\n\nAs regards part (c), claims 19 to 21 have essentially the same wording. They only differ from each other with respect to the compounds claimed, but do not in any way suggest that one of their compounds is preferred over the other two. Thus, similarly to part (b), part (c) also presents cobicistat at the same level of preference as examples P and X.\n\nIt follows that in each of the above cases cobicistat must be selected from an indication of equally preferred examples, i.e. an enumeration of items (\"list\"), to arrive at the subject-matter of claim 1.\n\n2.3 Thus to arrive at the subject-matter of claim 1 both atazanavir and cobicistat have to be selected from lists of the parent application as filed. It is established case law that such a double selection results in subject-matter which extends beyond the content of the (parent) application as filed unless there is a pointer to the specific combination claimed. However, in the present case there is no such pointer.\n\n2.4 The respondent took the view that the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request was directly and unambiguously disclosed in the parent application as filed for the following reasons:\n\n2.4.1 According to the respondent, the parent application as filed disclosed (see e.g. part (a) above) and encompassed (see e.g. claim 1 as filed) a multitude of different compounds. Of these compounds, three, including cobicistat, were elevated above all the others in the parent application as filed. At least parts (b) to (d) of the parent application as filed, therefore, were not to be understood according to case law as lists from which cobicistat had to be selected. This was particularly true of claims 19 to 21. As they contained cobicistat in individualised form in claim 20, cobicistat was a standalone embodiment of the invention and did not require a selection. This view was confirmed by decisions T 735/19 and T 2635/18. At the very least, the fact that cobicistat was individualised in claim 20 had to be understood as a pointer to precisely this compound.\n\nThe board cannot agree with this argument. The concept of lists does not require a list necessarily to have a particular format, for example a table or with each item introduced with a number or bullet point, nor is it applicable only to such formats. Rather, the information conveyed to the skilled person is crucial. If the skilled person is confronted with an indication of equally preferred items, this indication of items forms an enumeration or \"list\". Although it may be more obvious for parts (a), (b) and (d) that their indication of compounds forms a list, it is also true of part (c), i.e. claims 19 to 21. This can be illustrated by the fact that, as far as the disclosure is concerned, there is no difference between part (c), mentioning examples P, S and X in individual claims, and the hypothetical situation in which these examples are all contained in a single claim, the latter situation being more akin to what is usually referred to as a list.\n\nSince claims 19 to 21 form a list, the mere fact that cobicistat is individualised in claim 20 cannot be understood as a pointer to this compound as argued by the respondent - a view that might possibly have been accepted if cobicistat had been the only compound mentioned in the claims.\n\nThat claims 19 to 21 form a list, of which limitation to only one constitutes a selection, is precisely what distinguishes the present case from those underlying decisions T 735/19 and T 2635/18, on which the respondent relied to support its argument that a claim was a standalone embodiment and that a limitation to its subject-matter did not constitute a selection.\n\nIn T 2635/18 (Reasons, point 3.1.1), it was indeed held that starting from the embodiment of a dependent claim of the application as filed did not constitute a selection. However, contrary to the present case, with regard to the dependent claim in question, there were no other dependent claims with regard to which a selection would have had to be made. A similar assessment was made in case T 735/19 (Reasons, point 1.2), albeit with regard to Article 54 EPC. The claim at issue was directed to a contact lens comprising, inter alia, a hydrogel comprising phosphorylcholine groups. Dependent claim 32 of the prior-art document relevant to novelty of the subject-matter of the claim at issue disclosed a contact lens comprising as a component a polymer of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and a phosphorylcholine derivative. The competent board held that starting from the embodiment of claim 32 did not constitute a selection. This conclusion again is not in contradiction to that in the present case because in T 735/19 there were no other dependent claims in the relevant prior-art document relating to compounds which were preferred equally to that of dependent claim 32.\n\n2.4.2 The respondent also argued that even if claims 19 to 21 were considered as a list, this list was very short. In this context, decision T 2037/17 was relevant. This decision found a double selection from two very short lists to be an allowable amendment.\n\nThe board cannot agree with this argument either. The fact that the lists in passages (b) to (d) and in particular in claims 19 to 21 comprise only three compounds and are thus to be regarded as very short, as submitted by the respondent, does not render a selection superfluous. Even if decision T 2037/17 (Reasons, point 1.3) were understood to mean that a double selection from two lists of only two items was allowable, as argued by the respondent, this has no bearing on the present case, where the lists including cobicistat and atazanavir comprise three and significantly more than two items, respectively.\n\n2.5 It follows that claim 1 does not meet the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC. The main and only request is not allowable.",

Die Beschwerde richtet sich gegen die Entscheidung der Prüfungsabteilung, die Europäische Patentanmeldung 08759205.1 unter Artikel 97(2) EPÜ zurückzuweisen.\n\nII. Die streitgegenständliche Patentanmeldung dreht sich um Gemische aus linearen, ungeradzahligen Kohlenwasserstoffen, die als Grundkörper für kosmetische Formulierungen Verwendung finden.\n\nIII. Die Entscheidung der Prüfungsabteilung stützt sich auf das Dokument D6:\n\nD6:    WO2007/068371\n\nDie Prüfungsabteilung stellte fest, dass das für die vorliegende Anmeldung gültige Prioritätsdatum der 3. April 2008 ist, so dass D6 unter Artikel 56 EPÜ relevant ist.\n\nDie Prüfungsabteilung kam in ihrer Entscheidung zu dem Schluss, dass der Fachmann die im Prüfungsverfahren beanspruchten Kohlenwasserstoffgemische auf der Suche nach Alternativen zu den in D6 beschriebenen Komponenten kosmetischer Formulierungen ohne erfinderisches Zutun aufgefunden hätte. Mischungen definierter ungeradzahliger Kohlenwasserstoffe seien in D6 als Komponenten von Kosmetika vorgeschlagen. Die Auswahl der beanspruchten Mischungen aus der allgemeinen Lehre der D6 erfordere kein erfinderisches Handeln.\n\nIV. In ihrer Beschwerdebegründung brachte die Beschwerdeführerin vor, der Einwand mangelnder erfinderischer Tätigkeit sei unberechtigt. Ein Fachmann hätte aus D6 nicht die Lehre entnommen, dass beliebige Mischungen ungeradzahliger Kohlenwasserstoffe für die Kosmetikindustrie geeignet seien. Die in den Ansprüchen getroffene Auswahl spezieller Gemische sei dem Fachmann daher nicht nahegelegt. Des weiteren reichte sie Vergleichsversuche ein, die ihrer Ansicht nach eine gegenüber D6 verbesserte Sensorik der beanspruchten Gemische nachweisen.\n\nV. Am 1. Oktober 2019 erließ die Kammer eine Mitteilung unter Artikel 15(1) VOBK 2007 in der sie ihre vorläufige Auffassung der Sach- und Rechtslage darlegte. Die Kammer war insbesondere der Auffassung, dass die beanspruchten Gemische dem Fachmann aus D6 nahegelegt würden und dass die eingereichten Vergleichsversuche keine Verbesserung der beanspruchten Gemische gegenüber D6 belegten.\n\nVI. Mit Schreiben vom 12. März 2021 reichte die Beschwerdeführerin zwei beschränkte Anspruchssätze als Haupt- und Hilfsantrag ein. Sie brachte vor, die mit der Beschwerdebegründung vorgelegten Vergleichsversuche belegten eine Verbesserung sensorischer Eigenschaften der nunmehr beanspruchten Gemische.\n\nVII. Am 23. März 2021 fand die mündliche Verhandlung statt, die mit Einverständnis der Beschwerdeführerin wegen der andauernden Corona-Pandemie als Videokonferenz durchgeführt wurde.\n\nVIII. Die Beschwerdeführerin beantragte die Aufhebung der angefochtenen Entscheidung und die Erteilung eines Patents auf Basis des Hauptantrags, hilfsweise auf Basis des Hilfsantrags, beide eingereicht mit Schreiben vom 12. März 2021.\n\nDie von der Beschwerdeführerin im Verfahren im Detail vorgebrachten Argumente sind unten in den Entscheidungsgründen wiedergegeben.\n\nIX. Der unabhängige Anspruch des Hauptantrags lautet:\n\nKohlenwasserstoff-Gemisch, das ein Kohlenwasserstoff-Gemisch mit mindestens zwei voneinander verschiedenen Kohlenwasserstoffen enthält, wobei die zwei voneinander verschiedenen Kohlenwasserstoffe ausgewählt sind aus linearen C15 und linearen C17 Kohlenwasserstoffen, wobei diese zwei voneinander verschiedenen Kohlenwasserstoffe mindestens 70 Gew.-% bezogen auf die Summe der Kohlenwasserstoffe ausmachen.\n\nDer unabhängige Anspruch des Hilfsantrags lautet:\n\nKohlenwasserstoff-Gemisch, das ein Kohlenwasserstoff-Gemisch mit mindestens zwei voneinander verschiedenen Kohlenwasserstoffe enthält, wobei die zwei voneinander verschiedenen Kohlenwasserstoffe ausgewählt sind aus linearen C15 und linearen C17 Kohlenwasserstoffen, wobei diese zwei voneinander verschiedenen Kohlenwasserstoffe mindestens 99 Gew.-% bezogen auf die Summe der Kohlenwasserstoffe ausmachen.",
         "Entscheidungsgründe\n\n1. Die Beschwerde ist zulässig.\n\n2. Erfinderische Tätigkeit (Artikel 56 EPÜ)\n\nHauptantrag\n\n2.1 Nächster Stand der Technik\n\n2.1.1 D6 bildet unbestritten den nächsten Stand der Technik. D6 wurde zwar nach dem ersten beanspruchten Prioritätsdatum veröffentlicht, allerdings ist der beanspruchte Gegenstand unbestritten erst in den am 3. April 2008 eingereichten Prioritätsanmeldungen offenbart. D6 wurde früher, nämlich am 21. Juni 2007 veröffentlicht,ist daher Stand der Technik unter Artikel 54(2) EPÜ und kann deshalb für die Beurteilung der erfinderische Tätigkeit herangezogen werden.\n\n2.1.2 D6 befasst sich mit der Frage, wie die Nachteile petrolbasierter Kosmetikbasen (insbesondere \"light emollients\"), die meist aus Mischungen verschiedener linearer und verzweigter Kohlenwasserstoffen bestehen, vermieden werden können.\n\nD6 schlägt hierfür vor, lineare Kohlenwasserstoffe definierter Länge herzustellen und einzusetzen; ein neues Herstellungsverfahren für diese Verbindungen wird beschrieben. Auf diese Weise können dann verschiedene Eigenschaften gezielt beeinflusst werden, etwa das Spreitverhalten, siehe die ersten vier Absätzen der Seite 1, den zweiten vollständigen Absatz auf Seite 2 oder den ersten vollständigen Absatz auf Seite 5.\n\nWeiterhin wird beschrieben, dass sich insbesondere ungeradzahlige Kohlenwasserstoffe für diesen Zweck eignen; dies geht etwa aus dem dritten und vierten Absatz auf Seite 4 hervor. Dort werden allgemein ungeradzahlige C7-C23-Alkane sowie deren Mischungen und exemplarisch C9, C11, C13 und C17 erwähnt. In den Ausführungsbeispielen werden entweder C11 oder C13 verwendet. In Anspruch 6 (in Verbindung mit Ansprüchen 8 und 10) wird ein Kohlenstoffbereich von C11-C15 als insbesondere bevorzugt angegeben.\n\n2.1.3 Die Ansprüche des vorliegenden Hauptantrags unterscheiden sich von der Offenbarung der D6 dadurch, dass Gemische beansprucht werden, die spezifisch eine Mischung linearer C15 und C17-Kohlenwasserstoffe enthalten; die Summe dieser beiden soll dabei mindestens 70% der enthaltenen Kohlenwasserstoffe ausmachen.\n\n2.2 Aufgabe und Lösung\n\n2.2.1 Nach Ansicht der Beschwerdeführerin wurde mittels der in Anspruch 1 definierten Gemische ausgehend von D6 die technische Aufgabe gelöst, Kohlenwasserstoffgemische als Basis insbesondere für dekorative Kosmetika aufzufinden, die gegenüber dem nächsten Stand der Technik verbesserte Eigenschaften in Bezug auf die Sensorik aufweisen. Eine verbesserte Sensorik beinhalte dabei das Zusammenspiel verschiedener Größen. Zum Nachweis der verbesserten sensorischen Eigenschaften wurde auf die beiden Vergleichsversuche verwiesen.\n\n2.2.2 Nach Ansicht der Kammer können die eingereichten Vergleichstests eine solche multifaktorielle Verbesserung der Sensorik gegenüber dem Stand der Technik nicht nachweisen.\n\nDer erste der beiden eingereichten Tests vergleicht eine 1:1-Mischung aus C15/C17-Kohlenwasserstoffen mit einer Referenz, die 50% einer solchen Mischung enthält, neben 50% einer 35:15-Mischung aus C11/C13-Kohlenwasserstoffen. Der zweite Test vergleicht eine 1:1-Mischung aus C15/C17-Kohlenwasserstoffen mit 100% C11.\n\nBeim ersten Test verändern sich eine Reihe von Eigenschaften. Beim zweiten Test verringert sich nur die Spreitung (spreadability), alle anderen der gemessenen Eigenschaften bleiben gleich. Der erste Test zeigt deutlich mehr Unterschiede der getesteten Mischung im Vergleich zur Referenz an als der zweite, obwohl die Referenzsubstanz im ersten Fall bereits zu 50% aus der im Anspruch definierten Mischung besteht. Im zweiten Fall ist die Referenzsubstanz hingegen strukturell viel weiter entfernt. Alleine diese Tatsache zeigt schon, dass die Vergleichstests nicht geeignet sind, gegenüber D6 einen durch die strukturellen Unterschiede, d. h. die Auswahl der C15/C17-Kohlenwasserstoffe, bedingten Effekt auf die komplexe Sensorik nachzuweisen, wie von der Beschwerdeführerin behauptet.\n\nAus den eingereichten Tests kann höchstens abgeleitet werden, dass eine Mischung von C15/C17-Kohlenwasserstoffen eine geringere Neigung zur Spreitung zeigt, als kürzerkettige Kohlenwasserstoffe wie das getestete C11.\n\n2.2.3 Die technische Aufgabe, die durch die beanspruchten, C15/C17-Kohlenwasserstoffe enthaltenden Mischungen gelöst wurde, war daher, ausgehend von den in D6 konkret offenbarten Zusammensetzungen Mischungen mit geringer ausgeprägtem Spreitverhalten aufzufinden.\n\n2.3 Naheliegen der Lösung\n\n2.3.1 Diese technische Aufgabe wurde auf naheliegende Weise gelöst.\n\nD6 beschreibt explizit die Möglichkeit, lineare Kohlenwasserstoffe definierter Kettenlänge herzustellen und nach dem Baukastenprinzip gezielt zu mischen, um damit spezielle Eigenschaften, wie etwa das Spreitverhalten, einstellen zu können (Seite 5, erster vollständiger Absatz). D6 gibt dem Fachmann auch Anhaltspunkte, welche Arten von linearen Kohlenwasserstoffen dazu zu verwenden sind, nämlich solche mit 7 bis 23, 9-17 oder 11-15 Kohlenstoffatomen (Anspruch 6 oder dritter und vierten Absatz auf Seite 4). Der Fachmann weiß daher, welche Arten von Kohlenwasserstoffen er mischen kann und er weiß auch, dass das Spreitverhalten durch Auswahl und Mischung der Kohlenwasserstoffe beeinflusst wird. Eine Mischung, die ein gewünschtes Spreitverhalten zeigt, kann daher durch routinemäßiges herumexperimentieren gefunden werden. Der Fachmann muss zur Lösung der gestellten Aufgabe nicht erfinderisch tätig werden.\n\n2.3.2 Die Argumente der Beschwerdeführerin sind nicht überzeugend.\n\nEs wurde vorgebracht, D6 enthielte keine Hinweise, wie bei der Auswahl bestimmter Kohlenwasserstoffe vorzugehen sei, um bestimmte Ergebnisse zu erhalten. Insbesondere würden in den Beispielen der D6 keine Mischungen, sondern Reinsubstanzen verwendet. Mischungen seien nur als Möglichkeit genannt, und es gebe eine große Anzahl potentiell möglicher Mischungen.\n\nD6 offenbart aber die Möglichkeit, durch die Auswahl und Mischung das Spreitverhalten zu beeinflussen. Ebenso ist die ungefähre Länge der bevorzugten ungeradzahligen linearen Kohlenwasserstoffe beschrieben, wie oben ausgeführt. Daher offenbart D6 einen möglichen Startpunkt, Wege zur Veränderung und den zu beobachtenden Parameter. Sollte der Fachmann ausgehend von den in den Beispielen offenbarten reinen C11- oder C13-Alkanen das Spreitverhalten verändern wollen, so würde er durch herumexperimentieren innerhalb der als bevorzugt beschriebenen linearen Kohlenwasserstoffe zum beanspruchten Ergebnis kommen. Die Beschwerdeführerin hat in der Beschwerdebegründung im übrigen selbst vorgebracht, dass ein Fachmann Kohlenwasserstoffe mit Kettenlängen unter elf und über 19 aus verschiedenen Gründen nicht für kosmetische Anwendungen verwenden würde; die zur Verfügung stehende Auswahl an Kohlenwasserstoffen ist daher noch weiter eingeschränkt. Eine große Anzahl an Versuchen ist somit nicht erforderlich, zumal die vorliegenden Ansprüche ja kein spezielles Mischungsverhältnis definieren, das etwa zusätzlich noch eingestellt werden müsste.\n\n2.4 Der Hauptantrag ist daher wegen mangelnder erfinderischer Tätigkeit nicht gewährbar.\n\nHilfsantrag\n\n2.5 Die Ansprüche des Hilfsantrags unterscheiden sich von denen des Hauptantrags durch das Merkmal, dass die beanspruchte Mischung 99 Gew.-% bezogen auf die Summe der Kohlenwasserstoffe der im Anspruch definierten C15/C17-Mischung enthält, statt nur mindestens 70%.\n\nDieses Merkmal spielt in der obigen Beurteilung des Hauptantrags keine Rolle. Die Analyse wurde unter der Annahme gemacht, ein Fachmann würde zur Lösung der gestellten Aufgabe die in D6 vorgeschlagenen Kohlenwasserstoffe verwenden und mischen. Im einfachsten Fall der Mischung zweier Kohlenwasserstoffe liegen diese in 100 Gew.-% bezogen auf die Summe der Kohlenwasserstoffe vor und entsprechen daher auch Anspruch 1 des Hilfsantrags. Dieses Merkmal leistet keinen erfinderischen Beitrag.\n\n3. Zusammenfassend ist festzustellen, dass der in der Entscheidung der Prüfungsabteilung festgestellte Mangel an erfinderischer Tätigkeit auch für die im Beschwerdeverfahren eingereichten beschränkten Anspruchssätze gilt.",

         "Motifs de la décision\n\nRequête principale: brevet tel que délivré\n\nActivité inventive\n\n1. Art antérieur le plus proche\n\nLa Chambre, en accord avec les parties et la division d'opposition, considère que le document E2 représente l'état de la technique le plus proche de l'invention.\n\nCe document divulgue que des compositions comprenant le 2,3,3,3-tétrafluoropropène (HFO-1234yf) peuvent être utilisées comme fluide de transfert de chaleur, en particulier celles comprenant additionnellement moins de 1% en poids d'au moins un composé choisi parmi le HFO-1234ze, HFC-254eb, HFC-254fb, HFO-1243zf, HFC-245eb, HFC-245fa, HFC-245cb, HFC-236cb, HFC-236ea, HFC-236fa, HFC-227ea, HFC-227ca, HFO-1225yc, HFO-1225zc, HFO-1225ye, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyne, méthane, éthane, propane, HFC-23, HFC-143a, HFC-134, HFC-134a, HFO-1132a, et le FC-1216 (page 1, lignes 15 à 17; page 1, ligne 27 à page 2, ligne 7, page 4, lignes 6 et 7).\n\nCes compositions peuvent être utilisées comme agent de transfert de chaleur dans la climatisation stationnaire ou automobile, dans la réfrigération et les pompes à chaleur (page 4, lignes 16 à 28).\n\nL'exemple 3 du document E2 divulgue la préparation du HFO-1234yf par la déshydrofluoration du 1,1,1,2,3 pentafluoropropane (HFC-245eb). Le produit brut obtenu comprend 96.1% en poids de HFO-1234yf, 0.5% en poids du HFO-1234ze (Z) et 0.1% en poids du HFO-1234ze (E), ainsi que 2.9% de HFC-245eb n'ayant pas réagi.\n\n2. Problème technique\n\nLe requérant définit le problème technique à la base de l'invention comme la mise à disposition d'une composition de transfert de chaleur basée sur le HFO-1234yf qui présente une grande stabilité vis-à-vis du lubrifiant, plus pure que celle divulguée dans le document E2 et qui soit simple à fabriquer.\n\n3. Solution\n\nLa solution proposée est la composition de la revendication 1 du brevet tel que délivré caractérisée en ce qu'elle comprend au moins 99,85 % en poids de HFO-1234yf et au moins 0,02% en poids d'un isomère de position du 2,3,3,3 tétrafluoropropène, tel que le HFO-1234ze (Z) ou (E).\n\nD'autres part, des teneurs maximales en d'autres composés sont imposées, à savoir\n\nau plus 200 ppm de 3,3,3-trifluoropropyne,\n\nau plus 5 ppm de 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropène (HFO-1225ye),\n\nau plus 400 ppm de composés choisis parmi le HFC 254eb, le HFC-245eb, le HFC-134a, le HFC-143, le 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane, l'hexafluoropropène, le cyclohexafluoropropène et le HFO-1225zc.\n\n4. Succès\n\nUne partie du problème technique à résoudre est relative à la mise à disposition d'une composition plus pure simple à fabriquer. Dans les exemples du brevet litigieux, la composition selon l'invention a été obtenue en prenant du HFO-1234yf commercial d'une grande pureté et en y ajoutant les produits secondaires. Il n'a donc pas été montré dans le brevet litigieux en quoi consiste la simplicité de fabrication. Par conséquent, la simplicité de fabrication de la composition plus pure n'est pas prise en considération dans la formulation du problème technique.\n\n5. Reformulation du problème technique\n\nLe problème technique à résoudre se résume donc en la mise à disposition d'une composition purifiée de transfert de chaleur qui présente une grande stabilité vis-à-vis d'un lubrifiant comme les esters de polyalkylène glycol (PAG).\n\nLa chambre est convaincue que ce problème reformulé est résolu par la solution proposée, ce qui n'est pas contesté.\n\n6. Evidence\n\n6.1 La seule question en suspens est de déterminer si la solution proposée pour résoudre le problème technique reformulé découle de façon évidente de l'état de la technique, en d'autres termes, s'il était évident pour la personne du métier qu'une composition comprenant entre 99,85% et 99,98% en poids de HFO-1234yf, et les produits secondaires requis ou tolérés par la revendication 1, soit stable en présence de lubrifiants, tels les esters de polyalkylène glycols (PAG), dans les conditions utilisées dans les opérations de transfert de chaleur, par exemple la réfrigération.\n\n6.2 Le procédé de préparation de l'exemple 3 du document E2 fournit une composition brute qui comprend 96.1% en poids de HFO-1234yf, 0.5% en poids du HFO-1234ze (Z), 0.1% en poids du HFO-1234ze (E), ainsi que 2.9% de HFC-245eb, qui est le produit de départ n'ayant pas réagi.\n\nLe document E2 enseigne que pour une utilisation du HFO-1234yf comme fluide de transfert de chaleur, une purification du produit brut obtenu est nécessaire afin que la quantité totale de produits secondaires soient compris entre 0 et 1% en poids (page 2, lignes 6 et 7; page 3, lignes 30 à 32).\n\nComme souligné par le requérant, il est généralement souhaitable d'obtenir un produit sous la forme la plus pure possible afin de bénéficier des propriétés du produit en question et d'éviter tout inconvénient lié à la présence d'impureté. Il est aussi généralement souhaitable de limiter les opérations de purification du produit si celles-ci sont coûteuses et contraignantes.\n\nPar conséquent, la personne du métier procédera de façon routinière à la purification du produit brut obtenu dans l'exemple 3 du document E2 jusqu'à obtenir un degré de pureté satisfaisant pour l'utilisation souhaitée. Le document E2 divulgue que le HFO-1234yf peut être séparé des autres produits ayant un point d'ébullition différant par des moyens conventionnels, par exemple par distillation (page 20, lignes 18 à 27).\n\nEn conséquence, la personne du métier souhaitant résoudre le problème technique défini au paragraphe 5. ci-dessus arrivera aux compositions de la revendication 1 de la requête principale sans activité inventive.\n\n6.3 Selon le requérant, l'invention ne réside pas dans une composition de HFO-1234yf ayant un grand degré de pureté, mais au contraire, dans la découverte que le HFO-1234yf peut contenir des isomères de position sans que cela ne nuise à sa stabilité lorsque il est en présence de lubrifiants pour une utilisation comme fluide de transfert de chaleur, la stabilité d'un agent de transfert de chaleur en présence de lubrifiant n'étant pas prévisible s'il contient des produits secondaires.\n\nLe requérant s'appuie notamment sur le paragraphe 5.11.2.1 en page 4 du document E25 qui énonce que la quantité maximale des impuretés insaturés dans les réfrigérants fluorés saturés ne devrait pas dépasser 40 ppm, pour conclure qu'il n'était pas prévisible qu'une composition de HFO-1234yf comprenant plus que 200 ppm d'isomères de position du HFO-1234yf ait une stabilité satisfaisante vis-à-vis des lubrifiants.\n\nMise à part que cet argument ignore que la détermination du degré de pureté nécessaire à l'utilisation d'un produit fait partie des taches que la personne du métier effectue de façon routinière, cet argument est aussi en premier lieu en contradiction avec le fait que la composition de la revendication 1 de la requête principale puisse contenir jusqu'à 1300 ppm de produits secondaires non identifiés.\n\nD'autre part, le paragraphe cité dans document E25 concerne la présence d'impuretés insaturées dans des réfrigérants hydrofluorocarbonés saturés. Cet enseignement ne s'applique pas nécessairement à la présence de produits hydrofluorocarbonés insaturés dans un réfrigérant hydrofluorocarboné insaturé, d'autant plus lorsqu'il s'agit de simples isomères de position.\n\nCet argument du requérant doit donc être rejeté.\n\n6.4 Selon le requérant, en partant de la composition de l'exemple 3 du document E2 l'homme du métier ne parviendrait pas à la composition de la revendication 1 de la requête principale, puisque la teneur en HFC-245 exige une réduction de 2,9% à moins de 400 ppm, soit d'un facteur d'environ 72, alors que la teneur en HFO-1234ze (Z et E) doit rester supérieure à 200 ppm, ce qui requiert un facteur de réduction inférieur.\n\nCependant, ces considérations ne sont pas pertinentes, car la facilité de séparation de produits secondaires n'est pas transposable d'un produit à l'autre puisqu'elle dépend notamment des propriétés physiques des produits à séparer, tels que le point d'ébullition ou l'habilité à former éventuellement un azéotrope. L'élimination de produits secondaires lors d'une distillation n'est donc pas proportionnelle à la quantité de départ de chaque produit.\n\nCet argument du requérant doit donc aussi être rejeté.\n\n6.5 Selon le requérant, il n'est pas évident que la composition revendiquée, qui exige par ailleurs des teneurs maximales en d'autres produits puisse être obtenu par des opérations de distillation en partant de la composition l'exemple 3 du document E2. D'autre part, les spécifications requises pour la composition de la revendication 1 du brevet tel que délivré ne sont pas arbitraires, mais résultent d'un compromis entre la nécessité de purification du HFO-1234yf et les besoins de stabilité en présence de lubrifiants, la toxicité de produits secondaires et leur impact sur le réchauffement climatique.\n\nCependant, outre le fait que la recherche d'un compromis relève généralement des compétences de l'homme du métier, le requérant n'a pas montré que les seuils de concentration des produits secondaires indiqués dans la revendication 1 de la requête principale étaient critiques pour parvenir à ce compromis. D'autre part, la composition de HFO-1234yf revendiquée inclut une composition binaire avec un de ses isomères de position, par exemple le HFO-1234zeE. La présence dans les limites indiquées de composés fluorés, tel les 3,3,3-trifluoropropyne, HFO-1225ye, HFC-254eb, HFC-245eb, HFC-134a, HFC-143, HFO-1225zc, ne peut pas contribuer à l'activité inventive de la composition revendiquée puisque cette présence n'est qu'optionnelle.\n\n6.6 La Chambre arrive ainsi à la conclusion que la personne du métier à la lumière de l'état de la technique arriverait à une composition binaire comprenant entre 99,85% et 99,98% en poids de HFO-1234yf et entre 0,02% et 0,15% en poids d'un de ses isomère de position tel le HFO-1234zeE, en vue d'une utilisation comme fluide de transfert de chaleur avec une stabilité satisfaisante en présence de lubrifiant de façon routinière, et donc, sans faire preuve d'activité inventive.\n\nIl s'en suit que l'objet de la revendication 1 de la requête principale n'implique pas d'activité inventive.\n\nRequête subsidiaire 1\n\n7. Dans la requête subsidiaire 1, les isomères de position du HFO-1234yf sont limités au seul HFO-1234zeE.\n\nCette limitation n'a pas d'impact sur l'analyse d'activité inventive de la requête principale, puisque le document E2 divulgue que cet isomère de position est obtenu comme produit secondaire dans le HFO-1234yf préparé dans l'exemple 3.\n\nPar conséquent, l'objet de la requête subsidiaire 1 manque également d'activité inventive.\n\nRequêtes subsidiaires 2 à 9\n\n8. Les requêtes subsidiaires 2 à 9 concernent l'utilisation d'une composition selon la revendication 1 de la requête principale ou de la requête subsidiaire 1 comme agent de transfert de chaleur dans la climatisation stationnaire ou automobile, réfrigération et pompe à chaleur (requêtes subsidiaires 2 et 6), mise en ½uvre avec un lubrifiant (requêtes subsidiaires 3 et 7), choisi parmi (ou étant) les esters de polyalkylène glycols (requêtes subsidiaires 4, 5, 8 et 9).\n\nLe requérant a fait valoir la présence d'activité inventive des compositions revendiquées sur la base de leur stabilité lors de leur utilisation comme agent de transfert de chaleur dans la climatisation stationnaire ou automobile, réfrigération et pompe à chaleur en présence d'un lubrifiant constitué d'ester de polyalkylène glycols (PAG). La Chambre ne reconnait cependant pas la présence d'activité inventive des compositions sur la base de cet effet lors de ces utilisations. Par conséquent, le changement des revendications de composition en revendications d'utilisation des compositions comme agent de transfert de chaleur dans la climatisation stationnaire ou automobile, réfrigération et pompe à chaleur en présence d'un lubrifiant constitué d'ester de polyalkylène glycols (PAG), ne modifie pas l'appréciation de l'activité inventive.\n\nCes requêtes subsidiaires doivent par conséquent être rejetées pour manque d'activité inventive pour les mêmes raisons que celles des requêtes principale et subsidiaire 1.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The appeal lodged by the patent proprietor (appellant) lies from the opposition division's decision revoking European patent No. 2 621 517, entitled \"Composition for use in treating infertility\".\n\nII. An opposition had been filed against the patent in its entirety. The opposition proceedings were based on the grounds of lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC) in Article 100(a) EPC and on the grounds in Article 100(b) and (c) EPC.\n\nIII. The opposition division decided, inter alia, that the subject-matter of claims 1 to 4, 7, 9 and 10 of the patent as granted and claim 1 of each of auxiliary requests 1 to 4 lacked novelty. The subject-matter of claims 1 to 12 of auxiliary request 5 was held not to involve an inventive step.\n\nIV. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant submitted sets of claims of a main request (being identical to auxiliary request 4 considered by the opposition division), four new auxiliary requests and four documents (A20 to A23). It presented arguments in support of the requests in the context of added subject-matter, sufficiency of disclosure, novelty and inventive step.\n\nClaim 1 of auxiliary request 4 submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal reads:\n\n\"1. A product comprising follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for use in the treatment of infertility by controlled ovarian stimulation to develop one or more top quality embryos, wherein the FSH is for administration at a dose of 75 to 250 IU FSH per day starting on day one of treatment and continuing for two to twenty days; and the hCG is for administration at a dose of 140 to 190 IU hCG per day starting on day one of treatment and continuing for two to twenty days.\"\n\nClaim 2 of this request was dependent on claim 1.\n\nV. With its reply to the statement of grounds of appeal, the opponent (respondent) submitted a document (A24) and presented arguments why the appeal should be dismissed.\n\nVI. The board summoned to oral proceedings in view of corresponding requests of the parties and subsequently issued a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA setting out its preliminary opinion on the appeal. In the context of auxiliary request 4, the board expressed the view that it was not convinced that the claimed subject-matter lacked an inventive step.\n\nVII. Oral proceedings were held by videoconference with both parties' consent. The appellant withdrew the previous main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 3 and confirmed that former auxiliary request 4 was the new main request. At the end of the oral proceedings, the chair announced the board's decision.\n\nVIII. The following documents are referred to in this decision:\n\nD3 |Filicori et al. (2002) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 87(3), 1156-1161|\n\nD11|Filicori et al. (1999) Fertil. Steril. 72(6), 1118-1120 |\n\nD12|Filicori et al. (1999) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 84(8), 2659-2663 |\n\nD13 |Filicori et al.

The appellant's arguments, as far as relevant to the present decision, are summarised as follows.\n\nConsideration of document A24 in the appeal proceedings (Article 12(4) RPBA 2007)\n\nDocument A24 should not be considered in the appeal proceedings since it was not prima facie more relevant than other documents already on file. Moreover, it should have already been filed during opposition proceedings, considering that the dosage amounts of hCG as claimed in claim 1 of the main request were already present in independent claim 12 as granted.\n\nMain request\n\nInventive step (Article 56 EPC) - claim 1\n\nThe claimed subject-matter differed from the protocol for treatment of infertility by controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) disclosed in the closest prior art document D18 in the higher dosage amount of hCG administered concomitantly with FSH from day one of the treatment.\n\nThe technical effect of this difference was an increase in the number of top quality embryos. This was evident from the results of the study disclosed in the patent showing that an increased number of top quality embryos was obtained when administering 150 IU of hCG per day compared to the other doses tested (Table IV; page 5, paragraph [0019]). The patent further showed that to obtain an increased number of top quality embryos, particular hCG serum levels were already required on day six of the treatment that were only achieved with a daily hCG dose of 150 IU (Table VI). This observation further linked the dose of 150 IU hCG per day to an increased number of top quality embryos.\n\nThe technical effect was thus disclosed in the patent and should be taken into account for the assessment of inventive step. Since document D18 neither analysed nor mentioned the number of top quality embryos, the objective technical problem was the provision of a product and dosage regimen for the treatment of infertility by COS which provided an increased number of top quality embryos.\n\nThe claimed solution to this problem, namely administration of hCG at a daily dose of 140 to 190 IU starting on day one of treatment, would not have been obvious to the skilled person considering the disclosure in document D18 alone or in conjunction with the disclosure in documents D13 and A24.\n\nFirstly, none of these documents was concerned with the development of \"top quality embryos\", a known technical term defined in the patent (page 4, paragraph [0008], and page 9, paragraph [0048]). The purpose of developing top quality embryos was different from achieving high pregnancy rates in infertility treatment. The latter was the main purpose of the cited disclosures. Secondly, none of these documents would have motivated the skilled person to increase the dose of hCG administered in the protocol of document D18 from day one of the treatment.\n\nDocument 18 (on page 1012, left-hand column, third paragraph) stated that the alleged correlation of enhanced oestrogen secretion and oocyte and embryo quality was mere speculation. It went on to report that this correlation was neither observed in the study of document D18 nor in the study of document A22 (reference (11) of document D18). Furthermore, the results of the study disclosed in document A21 (reference (6) of document D18) were incorrectly presented. In this study, the oestrogen production had only been analysed as an index of follicular development (page 231, left-hand column, first full paragraph), and embryo quality had not been examined at all. Therefore, the teaching of document A21 did not support the hypothesis that enhanced oestrogen secretion might lead to better quality oocytes and embryos.\n\nFurthermore, document A24 (reference (5) in document D18) merely reported that the combination of FSH and hCG at a dose of 50 IU per day accelerated the development of ovarian follicles but did not correlate a higher ovarian oestrogen secretion with oocyte or embryo quality (page 278, left-hand column, fourth paragraph, reporting the results of document D11).\n\nDocument A24 mentioned a \"low-dose hCG\" of 50 to 200 IU per day only in the context of a different treatment protocol in which hCG was administered only from day eight of FSH treatment (page 278, left-hand column, fifth paragraph, to right-hand column, first paragraph). The skilled person would not have combined this fundamentally different treatment protocol with the treatment protocol of document D18. Furthermore, in the study of document D3, the results of which this passage of document A24 reported, treatment with FSH and hCG was found not to affect serum estradiol levels (document D3, page 1158, Table 3). The teaching of document A24 thus would not have motivated the skilled person to increase the hCG dose in the protocol of document D18 to 140 to 190 IU from day one onwards.\n\nAlso, document D13, a scientific review article, only reported a supplementation of FSH with 50 IU of hCG per day from day one of the treatment and thus likewise would not have motivated the skilled person to increase the hCG dose to 140 to 190 IU per day (page 548, left-hand column, middle of the second paragraph, and Figure 2, reporting the results disclosed in documents D11 and D12).\n\nFurthermore, like document A24, document D13 only discussed a dose of 50 to 200 IU hCG per day in the context of the treatment protocol of document D3 in which hCG administration was started only at day eight of FSH treatment (page 554, left-hand column, first full sentence). The skilled person would thus not have combined this treatment protocol with the one of document D18.\n\nMoreover, no effect on embryo quality was reported in documents D13 and D3. This was in line with the results shown in the patent (Table V) that starting hCG administration only at day eight of the FSH treatment could not be sufficient to increase the quality of the embryo since high hCG serum levels were already required on day six of the treatment for this effect.\n\nThe teaching of document D13 thus would not have motivated the skilled person to increase the hCG dose in the protocol of document D18 from day one of treatment, either.\n\nTherefore, the claimed subject-matter would not have been obvious to the skilled person from the teaching of document D18 alone or in combination with any of the cited documents and hence involved an inventive step.\n\nX. The respondent's arguments, as far as relevant to the present decision, are summarised as follows.\n\nConsideration of document A24 in the appeal proceedings (Article 12(4) RPBA 2007)\n\nDocument A24 was submitted in reply to the statement of grounds of appeal, in particular to newly submitted auxiliary request 4 and the appellant's allegation that the opposition division had misinterpreted the disclosure in document D18. Document A24 was reference (5) cited in document D18 and provided evidence of what the skilled person would have understood by the term \"low-dose hCG\" used in a passage of document D18 relevant for the assessment of inventive step. It supported the teaching of document D18 that hCG stimulated oestrogen secretion and that increased oestrogen levels could increase embryo quality, and was thus relevant for the assessment of inventive step. Document A24 should therefore not be excluded from the appeal proceedings (Article 12(4) RPBA 2007).\n\nMain request\n\nInventive step (Article 56 EPC) - claim 1\n\nThe claimed subject-matter differed from the disclosure in document D18, which represented the closest prior art in the amount of hCG administered to the patient, namely 140 to 190 IU of hCG per day instead of 100 IU per day. However, this difference was not associated with a technical effect.\n\nFirstly, the results shown in the patent lacked statistical significance due to the small sample size, the overlap in the data from the different treatment groups and the resulting risk of false positives. Secondly, even if it were accepted that the patent disclosed an increase in the number of top quality embryos when particular doses of hCG were administered from day one of the treatment, this effect was already achieved with the hCG dose used in document D18 (100 IU per day) and thus could not be associated with the difference of the claimed subject-matter over the disclosure in document D18.\n\nThe latter was evident from Table IV of the patent, showing that an increase in the number of top quality embryos already occurred when 100 IU of hCG per day was administered, and acknowledged in paragraphs [0008] and [0019]. No statistically relevant difference in the number of top quality embryos was shown for 150 IU of hCG compared to 100 IU of hCG.\n\nThe objective technical problem should thus be formulated as the provision of an alternative rather than an improved product. The administration of an hCG dose falling within the claimed range would have been obvious to the skilled person in view of the teaching of document D18 combined with the teaching of either document D13 or document A24, irrespective of whether the claimed hCG dose was seen as an alternative or an improvement.\n\nDocument D18 highlighted the increase in ovarian oestrogen secretion and serum estradiol levels and the associated increase of better quality oocytes and embryos when hCG was administered from the first day of treatment (page 1012, left-hand column, third paragraph).\n\nFurthermore, document D13 (reference (4) of document D18) was representative of what the skilled person's common general knowledge would have been in 2002 and reinforced the teaching of document D18 that low-dose hCG enhanced ovarian oestrogen production and stimulated the development of larger antral follicles (page 548, left-hand column, second paragraph) and that oestrogens improved follicle and oocyte quality and could result in the development of better embryos (page 548, left-hand column, third paragraph). On page 554, left-hand column, first full sentence, document D13 defined, with reference to document D3, \"low-dose hCG\" as a dose of 50 to 200 IU hCG per day and further suggested (on page 549, left-hand column, third paragraph) that \"higher LH activity ovulation-induction regimens should be explored to determine the optimal amount and timing\". The teaching of document D13 thus would have motivated the skilled person to increase the dose of hCG used in document D18 to improve embryo quality.\n\nDocument A24, a review from 2005 cited as reference (5) in document D18, also disclosed that hCG could be administered from day one of the treatment (page 278, left-hand column, penultimate paragraph, discussing the study of document D11) and that \"low-dose hCG\" would have been understood by the skilled person as 50 to 200 IU of hCG per day (page 278, left-hand column, last paragraph). The skilled person would have recognised from the context of these passages reviewing the relevant research in this field that the same \"low-dose hCG\" could also be applied in treatment protocols in which hCG was supplemented from day one of the treatment.\n\nThe appellant had argued, with reference to document A21, that the effects of hCG on oestrogen secretion and of oestrogen secretion on oocyte and embryo quality were controversial. However, since the review documents D13 and D18 published by leading authors in the field of COS supported this view, the skilled person would have had no reason to doubt that hCG increased oestrogen secretion and that higher oestrogen secretion was associated with a better quality of the resulting embryos.\n\nThus, the skilled person would have been motivated by the teaching of document D18, combined with either document D13 or document A24, to increase the dose of hCG in the protocol of document D18 to improve embryo quality. The subject-matter of claim 1 would therefore have been obvious to the skilled person and did not involve an inventive step.\n\nXI. The appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be maintained on the basis of the set of claims of the main request, filed as auxiliary request 4 with the statement of grounds of appeal.\n\nXII. The respondent requested that the appeal be dismissed.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The appeal complies with Articles 106 to 108 and Rule 99 EPC and is admissible.\n\nConsideration of document A24 in the appeal proceedings (Article 12(4) RPBA 2007)\n\n2. The appellant has requested that document A24 filed by the respondent in reply to the appeal be held inadmissible under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007. Pursuant to Article 12(4) RPBA 2007, the board has the power to hold inadmissible, inter alia, facts and evidence presented with the statement of grounds of appeal or the reply relating to the case under appeal and meeting the requirements of Article 12(2) RPBA 2007 that could have been presented in the proceedings before the opposition division.\n\n3. With its statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant submitted four new documents including documents A21 and A22 cited in document D18 which, in the decision under appeal, had been considered to represent the closest prior art. These documents supported the appellant's argument that the opposition division had misinterpreted the teaching of document D18. The board had no reason to exclude A21 and A22 from the appeal proceedings nor was this requested by the appellant.\n\n4. In reply to the appeal, the respondent submitted document A24, equally cited in document D18 in the same paragraph and context as documents A21 and A22. It provided evidence of what the skilled person would have understood by the term \"low-dose hCG\" used in document D18.\n\n5. While it might have been possible for the respondent to file document A24 during opposition proceedings, the board considered the filing of document A24 to constitute a reasonable development in response to the statement of grounds of appeal and was aimed at providing further details relevant for the assessment of inventive step without changing the case under appeal. The aspect of prima facie relevance relied upon by the appellant is not a mandatory criterion under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007 and was not taken into account by the board.\n\n6. Accordingly, the board saw no reason to hold document A24 inadmissible (Article 12(4) RPBA 2007) and consequently considered document A24 in the appeal proceedings.\n\nMain request\n\n7. In the context of the invention set out in the set of claims of the main request, the respondent has argued in the appeal proceedings solely that the subject-matter of claim 1 lacks an inventive step. Accordingly, this is the sole issue that needs to be decided.\n\nInventive step (Article 56 EPC) - claim 1\n\nClosest prior art and difference\n\n8. The parties agreed that the disclosure in document D18 represented the closest prior art. The board has no reason to diverge from this assessment.\n\n9. Document D18 discloses two protocols for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) for (subsequent) in vitro fertilisation comprising the daily administration of 150 or 225 IU of rFSH concomitantly with 50 or 100 IU of hCG for at least four days (page 1010, right-hand column, last paragraph). The patients receiving one of these two treatment protocols formed a single study group (\"low-dose hCG-supplemented group\") and were compared to a control group of patients that did not receive hCG supplementation (\"rFSH-alone group\"). No improvement compared to this control group as regards implantation and pregnancy rates were detected (Table 1, page 1012, left-hand column, second paragraph) despite higher levels of serum estradiol (Table 1, page 1012, left-hand column, third paragraph).\n\n10. The subject-matter of claim 1 differs from these treatment protocols in that the hCG is for administration at a dose of 140 to 190 IU per day and in that the infertility treatment by COS is \"to develop one or more top quality embryos\".\n\nTechnical effect and objective technical problem\n\n11. The opposition division considered the technical effect associated with this difference to be an increased number of top quality embryos. In appeal, the respondent contested this effect, arguing, inter alia, that the data disclosed in document D18 and the patent could not be compared.\n\n12. The board agrees with the respondent that since document D18 provides only the number of embryos resulting from the treatment but no information on their quality (Table 1), the data of document D18 and the patent cannot be directly compared. However, in the study disclosed in the patent, four patient groups were compared that received 0, 50, 100 or 150 IU of hCG per day concomitantly with 150 IU of FSH. The number of top quality embryos was analysed in relation to the hCG dose (Table V) and the serum hCG levels on day six of the treatment (Table V). Thus, the patent itself discloses a comparison of the number of top quality embryos developed after patients had received the same (50 or 100 IU) or higher (150 IU) amounts of hCG as administered in the study of document D18.\n\n13. These data show that the mean number of top quality embryos increases with increased hCG doses, peaking at 150 IU of hCG (Table IV). A statistically significant higher number of top quality embryos was obtained when a daily dose of 150 IU of hCG had been administered compared to 50 IU of hCG (Table IV, paragraph [0055]). It is concluded that \"there was a significant influence of hCG on the number of day 3 top-quality embryos. The highest number was found in the group given 150 IU of hCG per day\" (ibid.). The same conclusion is drawn in paragraph [0019]. Moreover, the data of Tables V and VI disclose that serum hCG levels on day six of the treatment of more than 8.0 IU/L were associated with a higher number of top quality embryos per patient (Table V) and that such hCG serum levels were only achieved when a hCG dose of 150 IU per day had been administered (Table VI).\n\n14. In view of these data, the board sees no reason to doubt that the administration of higher daily doses of hCG from day one of the treatment is associated with the subsequent development of an increased number of top quality embryos.\n\n15. The respondent further argued that the alleged technical effect could not be acknowledged as the data of Table IV were not statistically relevant due to the small sample size analysed for each patient group. Moreover, in view of the large standard deviations, no statistically significant difference in the number of top quality embryos was observed in the group treated with 150 IU of hCG compared to treatment with 100 IU of hCG. The technical effect was thus not associated with the difference of the claimed subject-matter to the disclosure of document D18.\n\n16. Although the data of the patent show that an increase in the number of top quality embryos already took place when 100 IU of hCG was administered compared to doses of 0 or 50 IU of hCG, the same data imply a further increase in the number of top quality embryos with a daily dose of 150 IU of hCG (see above point 13.). Consequently, according to the patent, administering the claimed hCG doses (140 to 190 IU) rather than the hCG dose used in document D18 (100 IU) further increases the number of subsequently developed top quality embryos.\n\n17. In this context, the board notes that the mere allegation that a study conducted with more participants might not confirm a further increase in the number of top quality embryos when administering 150 IU of hCG is not, as such, sufficient reason to deny the occurrence of this effect since a study conducted with more participants might equally likely confirm the effect. Consequently, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the respondent's arguments in this matter are considered mere speculation.\n\n18. In view of the above considerations, the board holds that the technical effect of an increase in the number of top quality embryos can be acknowledged for the claimed subject-matter.\n\n19. The objective technical problem may therefore be formulated as the provision of a product comprising FSH and hCG for use in the treatment of infertility by COS which allows for an increased number of top quality embryos to be developed.\n\nObviousness\n\n20. According to the decision under appeal and the respondent, the passage of document D18 discussing potential \"other benefits of low-dose hCG in addition to cost savings\" (page 1012, left-hand column, third paragraph) provided an incentive to the skilled person to increase the hCG dose used in the study of document D18 to improve oocyte and embryo quality.\n\n21. However, as already set out above (point 12.), document D18 is not concerned with the development of top quality embryos. Moreover, administration of 50 or 100 IU of hCG is pooled into a single \"low-dose hCG-supplemented group\" (Table 1) and compared to treatment with FSH alone, implying that the authors of document D18 did not expect different outcomes with different hCG doses.\n\n22. Furthermore, the board concurs with the appellant that this passage of document D18 reports conflicting results. On the one hand, with reference to document A24, \"[l]ow-dose hCG appears to be more effective in stimulating ovarian estrogen secretion than is rFSH alone\" and, with reference to document A21, \"[e]nhanced estrogen secretion may lead to better quality oocytes and embryos\". However, this hypothesis is subsequently contrasted with the observation that \"outcomes between the two groups in our study were the same\"; this \"supports the findings of a study [document A22] in which higher levels of E2 in supplemented cycles were not predictive of a better outcome\" (page 1012, left-hand column, third paragraph).\n\n23. Thus, contrary to the respondent's assertion, document D18 does not teach that increased ovarian oestrogen secretion was associated with a better outcome in fertility treatment or embryo quality. Instead, document D18 discloses that in its study, no differences in treatment outcome were observed despite increased serum estradiol levels in the \"low-dose hCG\" group (page 1012, left-hand column, second paragraph, and point 9. above). Therefore, according to the teaching of document D18, hCG supplementation neither affects implantation and pregnancy rates nor is as effective in stimulating follicles as FSH alone (page 1012, right-hand column, first paragraph).\n\n24. The respondent has further submitted that the paragraph bridging the left and right columns on page 1012 of document D18 would have motivated the skilled person to increase the hCG dose because, according to this paragraph, \"[t]he ideal regimen for administration of low-dose hCG\" remained to be optimised. However, the board notes that in the subsequent part of this section of document D18, supplementation with hCG at time points other than concomitantly with FSH is discussed. Hence, in the board's opinion, the \"ideal regimen\" mentioned in this section only relates to the time point of hCG administration and not to its amount.\n\n25. The board accordingly judges that the teaching of document D18 alone would not have provided the skilled person with an incentive to increase the dose of hCG administered in document D18.\n\n26. In a further line of argument, the respondent argued that the common general knowledge as reviewed in documents D13 and A24 would have motivated the skilled person to increase the hCG dose, firstly, since the documents confirmed the effect of hCG on oestrogen secretion, follicle development and development of better embryos and, secondly, since they defined \"low-dose hCG\", a term also used in document D18, as encompassing 50 to 200 IU of hCG.\n\n27. However, the board is not convinced by this argument, either. Both documents D13 and A24 summarise the results of two separate, independent and mutually exclusive treatment protocols in which hCG is either supplemented from the first day of FSH treatment or after a week of treatment with FSH alone. As regards concomitant administration of FSH and hCG, both documents report the results of the same publications, documents D11 and D12, in which 50 IU of hCG were administered concomitantly with FSH, with this leading to enhanced oestrogen production and/or follicle growth (see document D13, page 548, left-hand column, second paragraph and Figure 2; and document A24, page 278, left-hand column, second and third paragraph). Thus, these sections of documents D13 and A24 disclose that supplementation with 50 IU of hCG per day is sufficient to achieve the reported effects and hence would not have provided an incentive to further increase the hCG dose.\n\n28. In sections separate from the above, documents D13 and A24 summarise the results of the study of document D3, in which 0, 50, 100 or 200 IU daily hCG were administered from the eighth day of FSH treatment (document D13, page 554; document A24, page 278, left-hand column, last paragraph, and right-hand column, first paragraph; and document D3, Table 1). These hCG amounts are termed \"low-dose hCG\", and the same term is used in document D18 in the context of both its own treatment protocols and when discussing the protocol disclosed in document A24. However, as set out above (point 27.), documents D13 and A24 disclose that the observed effects of concomitant FSH and hCG administration were already achieved with a dose of 50 IU per day and do not provide any indication that these effects are dose-dependent. Thus, the teaching of documents D13 and A24 would not have prompted the skilled person to increase the hCG dose.\n\n29. Furthermore, there is no evidence that documents D13, D18 and A24 use the term \"low-dose\" in a more general sense and not just for the respective amounts administered in each separate treatment protocol. The board observes that the recited hCG doses are all \"low\" compared to the amounts of hCG administered in each treatment protocol after the gonadotropin treatment phase to trigger ovulation (5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG; see page 1011, left-hand column, first full paragraph of document D18; page 548, left-hand column, first paragraph of document D13; and page 281, left-hand column, last paragraph of document A24).\n\n30. In view of these considerations, the board holds that from the mere fact that the term \"low-dose hCG\" is used for 50 and 100 IU of hCG in the context of a first treatment protocol and for 50 to 200 IU of hCG in the context of a second unrelated treatment protocol, the skilled person would not have been motivated to increase the amount of hCG in the first treatment protocol. Thus, the respondent's arguments as regards this aspect do not convince the board.\n\n31. Finally, the respondent argued that document D13 would have provided a further motivation to use doses of hCG within the claimed range since it disclosed on page 549, left-hand column, third paragraph, that \"higher LH activity ovulation induction regimens should be explored to determine the optimal amount and timing\". However, this passage of document D13 relates to the administration of LH in the treatment of a specific disease, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, which requires a different treatment protocol than COS. Moreover, there is no indication in this section of document D13 that the amount of LH in the treatment of this disease was correlated with subsequent embryo quality.\n\n32. The board thus equally holds that this passage of document D13 would not have prompted the skilled person to increase the hCG amount in the treatment of COS according to document D18, either.\n\n33. In view of the above considerations, the claimed subject-matter of the main request was not obvious in view of the teaching of document D18 alone or combined with any of the cited documents. It therefore meets the requirements of Article 56 EPC.\n\n34. Claim 2, the sole further claim, is dependent on claim 1, and its subject-matter thus equally involves an inventive step.",

It reads:\n\n\"Hair treatment process comprising the application to the hair of an aqueous-alcoholic composition comprising at least 5% of at least one C1-C7 alcohol and at least one organic monoacid, followed by a straightening/relaxing step using a straightening iron at a temperature of at least 100°C, the process being performed without a step of permanent reshaping based on a reducing agent.\"\n\nV. In the decision under appeal, the opposition division decided that the subject-matter of claim 1 as granted involved an inventive step. The reasoning was as follows.\n\n- D1 was the closest prior art.\n\n- Claim 1 differed over example 4A of D1 in the concentration of C1-C7 alcohol (i.e. at least 5%).\n\n- D7 demonstrated that the process of claim 1 led to an improved direct and immediate straightening of the hair. The effect was shown to be linked to the distinguishing feature. D6 demonstrated that this effect was not always persistent after a washing step.\n\n- The technical problem to be solved over D1 was to provide a hair straightening process leading to an improved direct and immediate straightening effect.\n\n- There was no teaching in the prior art to increase the quantity of alcohol to improve hair straightening.\n\nVI. On appeal, the patent proprietor (respondent) filed six auxiliary requests.\n\nVII. The appellant's relevant arguments can be summarised as follows.\n\n- The subject-matter of claim 1 as granted differed from example 4A of the closest prior art D1 in the concentration of C1-C7 alcohol (at least 5%).\n\n- In view of the patent's examples, the only technical problem credibly solved at the time of filing of the patent was the straightening of the hair that persisted after washing of the treated hair.\n\n- The tests in D6 showed that a composition according to claim 1, with 30% ethanol, was inferior in persistence compared to an ethanol-free composition. Thus, the problem of improving straightening durability was not solved.\n\n- The patent proprietor's experimental tests in D7 investigated the straightening effect directly upon treatment, without shampooing. However, this effect was not the same as the one originally examined in the patent. Thus, D7 shifted the invention from solving the problem of durability of the hair straightening to durability of the hair straightening directly upon treatment.\n\n- In addition, stopping the treatment process before shampooing was an unrealistic set-up. The skilled person would not have left the high concentration of monoacids called for in claim 1 on the hair for a long period of time.\n\n- Furthermore, it was not credible that a technical effect would be found for all alcohols and monoacids of claim 1. Moreover, any effect observed in D7 was independent of the presence of alcohol. It was instead based on the fact that the tested compositions were in the form of an emulsion.\n\n- Therefore, the only technical problem solved over the entire scope of the claim was to provide an alternative hair straightening process.\n\n- The solution would have been obvious in view of D1.\n\nVIII. The respondent's relevant arguments can be summarised as follows.\n\n- D7 demonstrated the technical effect caused by the distinguishing feature of claim 1 over D1.\n\n- The effect, namely direct efficiency of the claimed process for straightening hair, was stated in the patent and the application as filed.\n\n- The durability of the straightening effect was a separate goal of the patent. It involved aspects such as persistence over time or after washing. D5 and D6 related to this type of persistence and did not compare claim 1 with the closest prior art.\n\n- Therefore, the technical problem was to achieve an improved direct straightening effect, and it was solved in a non-obvious way.\n\nIX. Final requests\n\nThe appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be revoked.\n\nThe respondent requested that the appeal be dismissed or, alternatively, that the patent be maintained on the basis of any of auxiliary requests 1 to 5 filed before the opposition division or any of auxiliary requests 6 to 11 filed with the reply to the statement setting out the grounds of appeal. Furthermore, the respondent requested oral proceedings if the board considered not granting the main request.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. Patent\n\nThe patent relates to a hair treatment process. It involves applying to the hair an aqueous-alcoholic composition comprising at least 5% of at least one C1-C7 alcohol and at least one organic monoacid, followed by a straightening/relaxing step using a straightening iron at a temperature of at least 100°C. The process aims, among other things, at straightening/relaxing and/or reducing the volume of hair efficiently and durably (paragraphs [0006] and [0007).\n\n2. Main request - inventive step\n\n2.1 The appellant contested the opposition division's decision on inventive step of claim 1.\n\n2.2 While it agreed on the selection of the closest prior art and the distinguishing feature, its view was that the technical problem was not solved. The experimental results in D6 proved that the only technical problem addressed in the patent, i.e. straightening of hair that remains persistent after washing of the treated hair, was not achieved over the entire scope of claim 1. Thus, the only problem solved was to provide an alternative process. This solution would have been obvious in light of D1.\n\n2.3 Therefore, the relevant question is whether the technical problem can be formulated as the opposition division did (see above, point V).\n\n2.4 The opposition division set out in its decision that:\n\n\"the problem of the remanence/resistance of the straightening to washing does not seem to be always achievable over the whole scope of claim 1 as demonstrated by D6. This was also not contested by the proprietor. However, the test results of D7 show another effect, namely the direct and immediate straightening of hair right after the straightening step with a hot iron. The persistence of the effect is not part of the technical problem and would represent a further advantage. This is in line with the technical problem defined in the patent specification on paragraphs [0006-8], i.e. the provision of a process which allows good straightening and/or reduction of the volume of the hair. Here even if the durability of the effect is mentioned, it is not specified if it concerns in particular the persistence after a washing step. In any case, D6 does not show the effect of the composition before the washing step, so that it could not be put in doubt that the problem of direct and immediate straightening of hair has been solved. Further, the opponent has not shown for which C1-C7 alcohol the effect could not be obtained. A mere assumption is not sufficient to shift the burden. Also ... it has not been shown that heterogeneous composition could not lead to a direct hair\n\nstraightening.\" (point II.6.9)\n\n2.5 This reasoning is both conclusive and convincing. Moreover, the appellant did not explain why the opposition division erred in stating that providing a direct and immediate straightening of hair was in line with the technical problem defined in the patent.\n\n2.6 The following additional observations are made.\n\n2.6.1 One of the aims of the patent is to develop a process for straightening/relaxing and/or reducing the volume of hair efficiently. This objective is directly disclosed in the patent, in paragraph [0006]. Therefore, the problem which the opposition division identified is at the very least derivable from the application as filed. In line with the case law of the boards, the problem does not even have to be explicitly disclosed in the application as filed: it suffices that it is foreshadowed in it (T 377/14, Reasons 2.1.5).\n\n2.6.2 D7 is the only document in which the process of claim 1 is compared with the corresponding process steps of the closest prior art (D1). The results in D7 demonstrate that efficient hair straightening is obtained.\n\n2.6.3 Here again, the considerations in T 377/14 (Reasons, point 2.1.6) are relevant for the current case:\n\n\"It is established jurisprudence that the patent proprietor (in the present case the respondent) can rely on a technical effect in formulating the objective technical problem, if it is proven to have been credibly obtained by the distinguishing feature(s). Only if this is not the case can the problem be reformulated in a less ambitious way as the provision of an alternative. Arguing the other way round, like the appellant in the present case, and saying that the provision of an alternative is obvious and that therefore any effect has to be disregarded ... would turn the problem-and-solution approach on its head, and thus is not permissible.\"\n\n2.6.4 Achieving a straightening effect that is durable is a different and separate goal of the patent mentioned in the same paragraph of the patent.\n\n2.6.5 D5 and D6 provide useful data for assessing a specific effect, namely the persistence of the straightening of the hair after washing it with a shampoo. However, this is just one aspect of the durability of the treatment. Durability includes different aspects, such as persistence of the straightening effect over time. It is not restricted to persistence after removal of the composition, e.g. after rinsing or washing the hair with a shampoo.\n\n2.6.6 The appellant argued that washing the hair at the end of the treatment would be a compulsory process step for the skilled person.\n\n2.6.7 This is not convincing. First, claim 1 does not call for a step of washing the hair, and therefore this step cannot be regarded as mandatory. Nor does the description state that such a step would be required or even essential. Second, D3 discloses leave-on hair compositions which contain an organic acid in an amount of up to 30% by weight. These compositions are not removed after application, neither by rinsing nor by shampooing. Instead, they are kept on the hair. Thus, there is no generic teaching in the art that would prevent the skilled person from leaving compositions on the hair which include a high concentration of organic monoacid.\n\n2.6.8 Finally, the appellant re-iterated the argument that it was not credible that all C1 to C7 alcohols could achieve the same technical effects. However, as the opposition division observed (point II.6.9 of the decision under appeal), there is no evidence that any of the alcohols or monoacids of claim 1 would not solve the technical problem. The same applies for the appellant's allegation that compositions would only be effective if they are provided in the form of a (homogeneous) emulsion.\n\n2.7 Thus, there is no reason to reformulate the technical problem identified by the opposition division.\n\n2.8 As concerns obviousness, the decision under appeal states the following:\n\n\"The opposition division is not able to find any teaching in D1, D4 or D3 that would encourage the skilled person to increase the quantity of alcohol in view of improving hair straightening. Therefore the skilled person would not have been led to the solution as defined by claim 1 of the contested patent from the teaching of D1 alone or taking into account the teaching of D3 or D4.\" (point II.6.7)\n\n2.9 The appellant did not show that the solution of the technical problem which the opposition division identified would have been solved in an obvious way.\n\n2.10 To conclude, the appellant did not convince the board that the opposition division's decision is to be set aside.",

This decision concerns the appeals filed by opponents 1 and 2 and the patent proprietor against the opposition division's interlocutory decision (decision under appeal), according to which European patent No. 2 487 166 (patent) in amended form meets the requirements of the EPC. Since all the parties are simultaneously appellant and respondent, they are referred to as opponents and patent proprietor for the sake of simplicity.\n\nThe patent originates from European patent application No. 12 167 596.1, which is a divisional application of European patent application No. 08 743 531.9.\n\nII. In preparation for the oral proceedings, scheduled at the parties' request, the board issued a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA 2020.\n\nIII. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the patent proprietor filed the set of claims of auxiliary request 1.\n\nIV. With the reply to the statements of grounds of appeal, the patent proprietor filed the set of claims of auxiliary request 3.\n\nV. The parties' final requests relevant to this decision were as follows:\n\n- Opponent 1 and opponent 2 requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be revoked in its entirety.\n\n- The patent proprietor requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be maintained in amended form based on\n\n- the set of claims of the main request, filed before the opposition division on 19 December 2017, or alternatively\n\n- the set of claims of auxiliary request 1, filed with the statement of grounds of appeal.\n\nAlternatively, the patent proprietor requested that the opponents' appeals be dismissed, implying that the patent be maintained in amended form as held allowable in the decision under appeal (auxiliary request 2).\n\nIn the further alternative, the patent proprietor requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent be maintained in amended form based on the set of claims of auxiliary request 3, filed with the reply to the statements of grounds of appeal.\n\nVI. The parties' appeal cases relevant to the present decision can be summarised as follows:\n\nOpponents 1 and 2\n\n- The subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 3 was the result of a double selection from the parent application as filed without there being any pointer to this effect. This view was supported by decisions T 1255/18 and T 3139/19. The main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 3 therefore did not meet the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC.\n\nPatent proprietor\n\n- Summaries of the patent proprietor's arguments are contained in the reasons for this decision.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\nMain request\n\n1. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:\n\n\"A pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula IIBb\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, and/or solvate thereof, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and at least one additional therapeutic agent which is selected from the group consisting of a HIV nucleotide inhibitor of reverse transcriptase.\"\n\nThe compound whose structure is shown in claim 1 is example S of the parent application as filed. In agreement with the parties, it is referred to as cobicistat hereinafter. Thus claim 1 relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising, inter alia, cobicistat and an HIV nucleotide inhibitor of reverse transcriptase.\n\n2. Amendments (Article 76(1) EPC)\n\n2.1 In line with the parties, the board refers to the published version (WO 2008/103949 A1) for the disclosure of the parent application as filed.\n\n2.2 The patent proprietor acknowledged that the HIV nucleotide inhibitor of reverse transcriptase is the result of a selection from the parent application as filed. The only dispute between the parties concerned the question of whether or not cobicistat involves a further selection.\n\n2.2.1 As regards cobicistat, the following parts of the parent application as filed are relevant (it should be recalled that example S is cobicistat):\n\n(a) page 217, line 1 to page 393, line 5, with syntheses of compounds according to the invention; four methods of synthesis for example S are disclosed on pages 251 to 259\n\n(b) page 194, lines 21 ff.; this passage reads:\n\n\"For example, such combinations can comprise Example P, S, or X, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, and/or ester thereof in combination with two or three additional therapeutic agents selected from the group consisting of [...]\"\n\n(c) claims 19 to 21; these claims read as follows:\n\n\"19.  A compound which is:\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester,\n\nand/or solvate thereof.\n\n20.  A compound which is\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester,\n\nand/or solvate thereof.\n\n21.  A compound which is\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester,\n\nand/or solvate thereof.\"\n\nEach of these claims is an independent claim. They relate to examples P (claim 19), S (claim 20) and X (claim 21).\n\n(d) page 401, lines 3 to 7; this passage reads:\n\n\"Experimental data based on representative Examples P, S, and T have a CYP450 3A4 inhibition activity in a range represented by an IC50 from about 80-150 nM, a CYP450 2C9 inhibition activity in a range represented by an IC50 from about 1000-10,000 nM, and a protease inhibition activity in a range represented by HIV EC50 greater than about 30,000 nM.\"\n\n2.2.2 Part (a) does not present cobicistat as preferred to the other examples of the parent application as filed.\n\nIn parts (b) and (d), cobicistat is presented at the same level of preference as two other examples, namely examples P and X and examples P and T, respectively.\n\nAs regards part (c), claims 19 to 21 have essentially the same wording. They only differ from each other with respect to the compounds claimed, but do not in any way suggest that one of their compounds is preferred over the other two. Thus, similarly to part (b), part (c) also presents cobicistat at the same level of preference as examples P and X.\n\nIt follows that in each of the above cases cobicistat must be selected from an indication of equally preferred examples, i.e. an enumeration of items (\"list\"), to arrive at the subject-matter of claim 1.\n\n2.3 Thus to arrive at the subject-matter of claim 1 both the HIV nucleotide inhibitor of reverse transcriptase and cobicistat have to be selected from lists of the parent application as filed. It is established case law that such a double selection results in subject-matter which extends beyond the content of the (parent) application as filed unless there is a pointer to the specific combination claimed. However, in the present case there is no such pointer.\n\n2.4 The patent proprietor took the view that the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request was directly and unambiguously disclosed in the parent application as filed for the following reasons:\n\n2.4.1 According to the patent proprietor, the parent application as filed disclosed (see e.g. part (a) above) and encompassed (see e.g. claim 1 as filed) a multitude of different compounds. Of these compounds, three, including cobicistat, were elevated above all the others in the parent application as filed. At least parts (b) to (d) of the parent application as filed, therefore, were not to be understood according to case law as lists from which cobicistat had to be selected. This was particularly true of claims 19 to 21. As they contained cobicistat in individualised form in claim 20, cobicistat was a standalone embodiment of the invention and did not require a selection. This view was confirmed by decisions T 735/19 and T 2635/18. At the very least, the fact that cobicistat was individualised in claim 20 had to be understood as a pointer to precisely this compound.\n\nThe board cannot agree with this argument. The concept of lists does not require a list necessarily to have a particular format, for example a table or with each item introduced with a number or bullet point, nor is it applicable only to such formats. Rather, the information conveyed to the skilled person is crucial. If the skilled person is confronted with an indication of equally preferred items, this indication of items forms an enumeration or \"list\". Although it may be more obvious for parts (a), (b) and (d) that their indication of compounds forms a list, it is also true of part (c), i.e. claims 19 to 21. This can be illustrated by the fact that, as far as the disclosure is concerned, there is no difference between part (c), mentioning examples P, S and X in individual claims, and the hypothetical situation in which these examples are all contained in a single claim, the latter situation being more akin to what is usually referred to as a list.\n\nSince claims 19 to 21 form a list, the mere fact that cobicistat is individualised in claim 20 cannot be understood as a pointer to this compound as argued by the patent proprietor - a view that might possibly have been accepted if cobicistat had been the only compound mentioned in the claims.\n\nThat claims 19 to 21 form a list, of which limitation to only one constitutes a selection, is precisely what distinguishes the present case from those underlying decisions T 735/19 and T 2635/18, on which the patent proprietor relied to support its argument that a claim was a standalone embodiment and that a limitation to its subject-matter did not constitute a selection.\n\nIn T 2635/18 (Reasons, point 3.1.1), it was indeed held that starting from the embodiment of a dependent claim of the application as filed did not constitute a selection. However, contrary to the present case, with regard to the dependent claim in question, there were no other dependent claims with regard to which a selection would have had to be made. A similar assessment was made in case T 735/19 (Reasons, point 1.2), albeit with regard to Article 54 EPC. The claim at issue was directed to a contact lens comprising, inter alia, a hydrogel comprising phosphorylcholine groups. Dependent claim 32 of the prior-art document relevant to novelty of the subject-matter of the claim at issue disclosed a contact lens comprising as a component a polymer of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and a phosphorylcholine derivative. The competent board held that starting from the embodiment of claim 32 did not constitute a selection. This conclusion again is not in contradiction to that in the present case because in T 735/19 there were no other dependent claims in the relevant prior-art document relating to compounds which were preferred equally to that of dependent claim 32.\n\n2.4.2 The patent proprietor also argued that even if claims 19 to 21 were considered as a list, this list was very short. In this context, decision T 2037/17 was relevant. This decision found a double selection from two very short lists to be an allowable amendment.\n\nThe board cannot agree with this argument either. The fact that the lists in passages (b) to (d) and in particular in claims 19 to 21 comprise only three compounds and are thus to be regarded as very short, as submitted by the patent proprietor, does not render a selection superfluous. Even if decision T 2037/17 (Reasons, point 1.3) were understood to mean that a double selection from two lists of only two items was allowable, as argued by the patent proprietor, this has no bearing on the present case, where the lists including cobicistat and the HIV nucleotide inhibitor of reverse transcriptase comprise three and significantly more than two items, respectively.\n\n2.5 It follows that claim 1 does not meet the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC. The main request is not allowable.\n\nAuxiliary requests 1 to 3\n\n3. Claim 1 of auxiliary requests 1 to 3 is identical to claim 1 of the main request. These auxiliary requests are therefore not allowable for the same reasons as given above for the main request.",

         "Exposé des faits et conclusions\n\nI. Le recours des titulaires du brevet (ci-après dénommées \"les requérantes\") est dirigé contre la décision de la division d'opposition par laquelle le brevet européen n° 3 107 556 (\"le brevet\") a été révoqué.\n\nII. Dans la décision contestée, la division d'opposition a examiné les jeux de revendications selon une requête principale modifiée et trois requêtes subsidiaires.\n\nIII. La division d'opposition a considéré que les modifications apportées aux revendications 9 et 10 de la requête principale ne contrevenaient pas à l'article 123(2) CBE.\n\nIV. Le nouveau motif d'opposition introduit par l'opposante dans sa lettre du 18 novembre 2020, soit deux mois avant la procédure orale, concernant l'insuffisance de l'exposé (article 100b) CBE) a été admis dans la procédure.\n\nV. S'agissant de la requête principale, la division d'opposition a conclu que le brevet ne remplissait pas les exigences de l'article 83 CBE, étant donné que l'exposé ne contenait pas suffisamment d'informations pour rendre crédible que l'homme du métier puisse utiliser le peptide AP pour traiter ou prévenir le diabète avec une dose différente de 5 ou 3000 mg (point 6.10 des motifs).\n\nVI. La division d'opposition n'a pas admis les requêtes subsidiaires 1 à 3, soumises par courriel pendant la procédure orale. Elle a admis le document D26 soumis par lettre du 18 novembre 2020, mais n'a pas admis les documents D22 à D25, D27 et D28 (tous soumis par lettre du 18 novembre 2020), D29 (soumis par lettre du 19 novembre 2020) et D30 (soumis par lettre du 19 janvier 2021).\n\nVII. Dans leur recours, les requérantes ont soumis des jeux de revendications d'une requête principale, identique à la requête principale sur laquelle la décision contestée avait été rendue, et des requêtes subsidiaires 1 à 7, soumises pour la première fois avec le recours.\n\nVIII. La revendication 1 de la requête principale s'énonce comme suit :\n\n\"1. Composition comprenant au moins un peptide AP pour son utilisation dans la prévention et/ou le traitement du diabète de type 2.\"\n\nIX. L'opposante (l'intimée) a répondu au recours.\n\nX. Les requérantes ont soumis par la suite un jeu de revendications selon une nouvelle requête subsidiaire 8.\n\nXI. Les documents suivants sont cités dans la présente décision :\n\nD16|T. Sartorius et al., \"Postprandial Effects of a Proprietary Milk Protein Hydrolysate Containing Bioactive Peptides in Prediabetic Subjects\", Nutrients 11(7), 2019, 1700 |\n\nD18|PEP2DIA® Report, 12, May 2020          |\n\nD26|JP 2003 238589 A                       |\n\nD27|H.

Gillespie et al., \"The Impact of ACE Inhibitors or Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers on the Development of New-Onset Type 2 Diabetes\", Diabetes Care 28(9), 2005, 2261-2266|\n\nXII. La Chambre a cité les parties à une procédure orale.\n\nXIII. Conformément à l'article 15(1) RPCR, la Chambre a notifié son avis préliminaire aux parties. Elle a, entre autres, indiqué\n\n- que les modifications apportées aux revendications 9 et 10 de la requête principale ne contrevenaient pas aux dispositions de l'article 123(2) CBE,\n\n- qu'elle était inclinée à annuler la décision par laquelle la division d'opposition avait admis le nouveau motif d'opposition,\n\n- qu'elle ne considérait ni le document D16 ni le document D18 comme de prime abord pertinents et qu'elle serait donc inclinée à juger non recevable le nouveau motif d'insuffisance de l'exposé (article 100b) CBE).\n\nXIV. L'intimée a ensuite retiré sa requête visant à la tenue d'une procédure orale, à condition que la Chambre renvoie l'affaire à la division d'opposition pour examen de la nouveauté et de l'activité inventive.\n\nXV. Les requérantes ont retiré leur requête visant à la tenue d'une procédure orale, à condition que la Chambre de recours confirme l'irrecevabilité du nouveau motif d'opposition et renvoie l'affaire à la division d'opposition pour l'examen de la nouveauté et de l'activité inventive.\n\nXVI. La Chambre a annulé la procédure orale.\n\nXVII. Les arguments des requérantes peuvent se résumer comme suit :\n\nRequête principale\n\nRecevabilité du nouveau motif d'opposition\n\nPour qu'un motif d'opposition soit de prime abord pertinent, il faut appliquer le degré de conviction allant au-delà de tout doute raisonnable.\n\nOr, le doute que l'opposante a tenté de soulever en invoquant D16 est contredit par les données de D18 qui, dans la partie 2 du rapport, démontrent bien qu'un produit contenant 500 mg/kg de Pep2dia® a un effet significatif sur la glycémie chez des souris, ce qui peut être converti facilement en un dosage de 8 mg pour un humain de 75 kg. Contrairement à ce qu'a indiqué la division d'opposition dans sa décision, D18 montre donc bien qu'un dosage de 8 mg est efficace dans le traitement ou la prévention du diabète de type 2.\n\nDe plus, une donnée statistiquement non significative, à savoir avec une puissance non appropriée pour la forte dose (7,68 mg AP), ne permet pas de conclure à l'absence d'effet dans l'étude clinique présentée dans le document D16 (point 6.4 de la décision). Ainsi le document D16 n'est pas de \"prime abord pertinent\" au regard de la forte dose et ne justifie pas l'introduction d'un nouveau motif d'opposition.\n\nRecevabilité des documents D26 à D28\n\nLa soumission tardive de D26 n'a pas été justifiée. L'intimée aurait dû introduire ce document pendant le délai d'opposition. Ce document ne répond pas non plus à une question soulevée par l'avis préliminaire de la division d'opposition. Par ailleurs, le document D26 n'est pas pertinent, car son contenu est lacunaire et erroné et n'apporte pas d'enseignement supplémentaire par rapport au document D6.\n\nXVIII. Les arguments de l'intimée peuvent se résumer comme suit :\n\nRequête principale\n\nRecevabilité du nouveau motif d'opposition\n\nLe nouveau motif d'opposition a été présenté en réaction aux documents D16 et D18 (en particulier D16) déposés par les titulaires avec leur réponse à l'acte d'opposition. Le document D16 fait état d'un essai clinique portant sur le dipeptide AP et les auteurs ont indiqué que pour un certain dosage du dipeptide AP, aucune différence significative n'a été observée par rapport au placébo.\n\nLe document D16 est un article scientifique post-publié, qui ne peut pas être facilement trouvé lors d'une recherche de l'art antérieur. Le document D18 est un rapport interne et confidentiel datant de mai 2020 et n'est pas accessible aux tiers. En conséquence, le nouveau motif d'opposition n'aurait pas pu être soulevé plus tôt, comme le mentionne à juste titre la division d'opposition au point 4.2 de sa décision.\n\nMême si le nouveau motif d'opposition était considéré comme ayant été déposé tardivement, la division d'opposition aurait toujours une obligation d'examiner la pertinence du nouveau motif d'opposition, et de l'admettre s'il était jugé pertinent de prime abord.\n\nLa lecture complète du document D16 révèle que le même ingrédient actif que celui spécifié dans la revendication 1 du brevet attaqué avait été administré dans le cadre d'une étude clinique à un groupe de patients approprié (sujets pré-diabétiques ; voir paragraphes [0062] et [0063] du brevet). La lecture du document D16 révèle également qu'une réponse biologique très pertinente a été observée (glycémie postprandiale ; voir par exemple paragraphe [0042] du brevet), et que les auteurs ont conclu que la \"forte dose\" (contenant 7,68 mg de dipeptide AP) ne fournit pas d'effet thérapeutique significativement différent du placébo.\n\nL'identification de cet enseignement très pertinent ne nécessite que la lecture du document D16 par l'homme du métier ; aucune autre hypothèse ou spéculation n'est nécessaire pour parvenir à la conclusion que les modes de réalisation selon l'objet de la revendication n'ont pas l'effet thérapeutique stipulé - cela est explicitement indiqué par les auteurs, et D16 répond donc au critère de \"pertinence de prime abord\".\n\nRecevabilité des documents D26 à D28\n\nL'enseignement de D26 est clairement différent de l'enseignement de D6. Comme expliqué au point 9.2. de la décision contestée, D26 remplit effectivement le critère de \"pertinence de prime abord\".\n\nLes documents D27 et D28 sont de prime abord très pertinents pour l'activité inventive.\n\nXIX. Requêtes\n\nLes requérantes ont requis :\n\n- l'annulation de la décision contestée\n\n- l'inadmissibilité du nouveau motif d'opposition selon les articles 83 et 100b) CBE\n\n- le maintien du brevet sous la forme de sa requête principale ou, à défaut, sous la forme de l'une des requêtes subsidiaires 1 à 8\n\n- l'admission de ces requêtes subsidiaires au stade du recours\n\n- l'admission des nouveaux documents D31 à D35 au stade du recours\n\n- l'inadmissibilité du document D26\n\n- la confirmation de la décision de la division d'opposition que les documents D22 à D25, D27, D28 et D30 n'étaient pas admissibles\n\n- le renvoi de l'affaire, si le brevet était considéré comme conforme aux exigences de l'article 83 CBE ou si la Chambre devait conclure que la division d'opposition n'avait pas exercé correctement son pouvoir discrétionnaire en admettant le nouveau motif d'opposition.\n\nL'intimée a requis :\n\n- que le recours soit rejeté et que la décision contestée soit confirmée\n\n- que les requêtes subsidiaires 1 à 7 ne soient pas admises\n\n- que la chambre confirme l'admission du document D26\n\n- que les documents D27 et D28 soient admis\n\n- que les documents D31 à D35 ne soient pas admis\n\n- si l'un quelconque des documents D31 à D35 devait être admis, que les documents D36 et D37 soient également admis\n\n- le renvoi de l'affaire, si le brevet était considéré comme conforme aux exigences de l'article 83 CBE ou si la Chambre devait conclure que la division d'opposition n'avait pas exercé correctement son pouvoir discrétionnaire en admettant le nouveau motif d'opposition.\n\nL'intimée a aussi requis que, si la Chambre décidait de renvoyer l'affaire, elle le fasse en donnant l'instruction d'admettre D27 et D28 dans la procédure ou de reprendre la discussion sur la recevabilité de ces documents.",
         "Motifs de la décision\n\nRecevabilité du nouveau motif d'opposition\n\n1. Selon l'avis G 10/91, à titre exceptionnel, la division d'opposition peut, en application de l'article 114(1) CBE, examiner d'autres motifs d'opposition qui, de prime abord, semblent en tout ou en partie s'opposer au maintien du brevet européen.\n\n2. Une chambre de recours ne devrait statuer dans un sens différent de la manière dont l'instance du premier degré a exercé son pouvoir d'appréciation que si elle parvient à la conclusion que l'instance du premier degré a exercé son pouvoir d'appréciation sur la base de principes erronés, qu'elle n'a pas tenu compte des principes corrects, ou qu'elle a exercé son pouvoir de manière arbitraire ou déraisonnable et a ainsi outrepassé les limites du pouvoir d'appréciation qui lui est conféré (cf. à cet égard en particulier la décision G 7/93, JO 1994, 775).\n\n3. Dans sa décision, la division d'opposition a donné plusieurs raisons pour admettre le nouveau motif :\n\n1) le motif n'était pas tardif, car il représentait\n\n\"une réaction aux documents D16 et D18 soumis par la titulaire avec sa réponse au mémoire d'opposition\" [et que] \"cette objection n'aurait pas pu être soulevée préalablement\" (voir point 4.2)\n\n2) le fait que \"le titulaire lui-même suggérait le besoin d'entendre un expert technique dans le cadre de la suffisance de l'exposé, [...] est un signe clair que ce point doit être discuté\" (voir point 4.5)\n\n3) \"il doit être discuté si la divulgation des documents D16 et D18 jette de sérieux doutes sur le fait que l'homme du métier puisse réaliser l'invention telle que définie dans les revendications l à 4 en suivant les instructions figurant dans le brevet\" (voir point 4.6, premier paragraphe)\n\n4) \"le titulaire n'a pas fourni [...] de raisons pour lesquelles ce motif ne serait pas pertinent. Au contraire, les arguments du titulaire étaient surtout liés quant au fond de la suffisance de l'exposé\" (voir point 4.6, deuxième paragraphe).\n\n4. La Chambre est d'avis que la division d'opposition a exercé son pouvoir d'appréciation de manière déraisonnable, pour les raisons suivantes.\n\n5. Dans sa décision, la division n'a pas reconnu le caractère tardif du motif d'opposition selon l'article 100b) CBE (voir point 4.2). Pour la reconnaissance du caractère tardif d'un nouveau motif d'opposition, la question de savoir si le motif a été évoqué dans l'acte d'opposition ou omis dans celui-ci est décisive. Dans le cas présent, le nouveau motif est clairement tardif, car il n'a pas été présenté dans l'acte d'opposition et a été évoqué pour la première fois deux mois avant la procédure orale.\n\n6. Dans sa décision, la division n'a pas indiqué pourquoi le nouveau motif était de prime abord pertinent. Bien que ce critère soit mentionné au début de la section 4, il n'en est plus question par la suite. Le constat selon lequel \"il doit être discuté si la divulgation des documents D16 et D18 jette de sérieux doutes\" (voir points 4.6) semble plutôt suggérer que la division d'opposition considérait que la présence de sérieux doutes était discutable, ce qui est le contraire du principe de pertinence de prime abord. Aussi l'examen du contenu des documents D16 et D18 dans la décision contestée (voir points 5.2 à 6.10 des motifs) et la nécessité d'interpréter les résultats divulgués dans ces documents démontrent-ils que la division d'opposition considérait une analyse détaillée du document D16 comme nécessaire pour juger de sa pertinence.\n\n7. Le fait que les titulaires suggéraient \"le besoin d'entendre un expert technique dans le cadre de la suffisance de l'exposé\" représente une tentative de défense dans le cadre de l'article 113(1) CBE, qui ne peut pas être considérée comme un signe que le nouveau motif était de prime abord pertinent.\n\n8. La division était aussi dans l'erreur quand elle a demandé aux titulaires de donner des raisons pour lesquelles le \"motif ne serait pas pertinent\". Selon l'avis G 10/91, c'est plutôt à la division d'opposition qu'il revient d'expliquer pourquoi, de prime abord, le nouveau motif semble en tout ou en partie s'opposer au maintien du brevet contesté.\n\n9. En conclusion, la Chambre annule la décision de la division d'opposition d'admettre le nouveau motif d'insuffisance de l'exposé (article 100b) CBE). La Chambre doit donc réexaminer si le nouveau motif peut être admis dans la procédure. Les critères à utiliser à cette fin sont ceux qui s'appliquent à la procédure d'opposition. Dans le cas d'espèce, la Chambre considère le critère de la pertinence de prime abord comme déterminant.\n\n10. Les préparations utilisées selon le document D16 contiennent un mélange de peptides, sous forme d'hydrolysat de protéines de lait, avec 94,5 % de peptides de faible masse moléculaire (voir le document D16, page 5, lignes 7 à 10). La valeur probante des résultats rapportés pour l'effet spécifique du peptide AP (présent dans une relation d'en moyenne 0,96 mg sur 350 mg) est donc incertaine. Le document D16 parle des effets des peptides du lait plutôt que de ceux du peptide AP (voir document D16 : 3.2 et 4. \"Discussion\").\n\n11. De plus, la Chambre note que le document D16 ne considère pas que les résultats démontrent un manque d'efficacité de la forte dose (\"high dose\") ; il est seulement indiqué que ces résultats manquent de significativité statistique. La significativité statistique (valeur-p) est une valeur relative qui ne permet pas de conclure qu'un fait est vrai ou faux, mais qui donne une indication sur la probabilité d'obtenir les résultats observés d'un test, en supposant que l'hypothèse nulle (même effet que le placébo) est correcte.\n\n12. Le document D18 concerne une étude sur des rats avec le même produit que celui utilisé selon le document D16. Dans sa réplique au mémoire de recours, l'intimée ne s'appuie que sur le document D16 pour son argumentation relative à l'insuffisance de l'exposé.\n\n13. Pour ces raisons, la Chambre ne considère ni le document D16 ni le document D18 comme de prime abord pertinents et juge non recevable le nouveau motif d'insuffisance de l'exposé (article 100b) CBE).\n\nRecevabilité des documents D22 à D28 et D30 à D37\n\n14. La décision de la division d'opposition de ne pas admettre les documents D22 à D25, D29 et D30 n'a plus été contestée au stade de recours. Ces documents ne font donc pas partie du recours.\n\n15. Aucun des documents D31 à D37 n'est nécessaire ou pertinent pour la décision de la Chambre. Il n'y a donc pas lieu de traiter la question de leur recevabilité.\n\n16. La recevabilité des documents D26 à D28 reste contestée au stade de recours (voir mémoire de recours, points 3, 5 et 6, et réponse au mémoire de recours, point 5.3).\n\n17. Dans sa décision, la division d'opposition a analysé les documents D26 à D28 en tenant compte du dépôt tardif de ces documents et en évaluant leur pertinence, de prime abord, pour les questions de nouveauté et d'activité inventive. Ce faisant, elle a également comparé leur divulgation à celle des documents déjà présents dans le dossier et a évalué si les documents déposés tardivement apportaient des informations supplémentaires.\n\n18. En conclusion, la Chambre estime que la division d'opposition n'a pas commis d'erreur dans l'exercice de son pouvoir d'appréciation. La décision d'admettre le document D26 et de ne pas admettre les documents D27 et D28 est donc confirmée.\n\nRenvoi (article 111(1) CBE)\n\n19. La division d'opposition n'ayant pas statué sur les motifs d'opposition visés à l'article 100a) CBE, et compte tenu des demandes pertinentes des parties, la Chambre estime qu'il convient de permettre un examen en deux instances et, par conséquent, de renvoyer l'affaire à la division d'opposition pour l'examen de la nouveauté et de l'activité inventive.",
         "Dispositif, Par ces motifs, il est statué comme suit, 1. La décision contestée est annulée., 2. L'affaire est renvoyée à la division d'opposition afin de poursuivre la procédure.",

         "Sachverhalt und Anträge\n\nI. Das europäische Patent Nr. 2 498 762 (nachfolgend: das Patent) wurde mit neun Ansprüchen erteilt.\n\nDer Anspruchsgegenstand des erteilten Patents betraf ein Verfahren zur Verhinderung der Kristallisation des Arzneistoffs Rotigotin in einem Polymerfilm, in dem eine ausgestrichene lösungsmittelhaltige Beschichtungsmasse, in der Rotigotin in Form einer festen Lösung in einem matrixbildenden Polymer dispergiert ist, getrocknet wird bei Temperaturen, die nicht länger als 15 Minuten bei 10 bis 25 °C über der Schmelztemperatur des enthaltenen Rotigotins liegen.\n\nII. Gegen die Erteilung des Patents wurden drei Einsprüche eingelegt. Die Einspruchsgründe waren fehlende Neuheit und fehlende erfinderische Tätigkeit, unzureichende Offenbarung sowie unzulässige Erweiterung EPÜ.\n\nDie Beschwerden der Einsprechenden 01 (Beschwerdeführerin 01), der damaligen Einsprechenden 02 und der Einsprechenden 03 (Beschwerdeführerin 03) richteten sich gegen die Zwischenentscheidung der Einspruchsabteilung, dass das Patent unter Berücksichtigung der mit dem Hauptantrag vom 3. September 2018 eingereichten Änderungen den Erfordernissen des EPÜ genügt.\n\nAnspruch 1 dieses Hauptantrags lautete:\n\n\"Verfahren zur Verhinderung der Kristallisation des Arzneistoffs Rotigotin in einem Polymerfilm, dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass die für die Herstellung des Polymerfilms ausgestrichene lösungsmittelhaltige Beschichtungsmasse, umfassend ein matrixbildendes Polymer oder Polymergemisch und Rotigotin als Arzneistoff, der in Form einer festen Lösung in dem matrixbildenden Polymer dispergiert ist, mindestens 100 Sekunden und nicht länger als 10 Minuten bei einer 10 bis 25 °C über dem Schmelzpunkt des in der Beschichtungsmasse enthaltenen Arzneistoffs liegenden Temperatur getrocknet wird.\"\n\nIm Einspruchsverfahren wurde unter anderem das folgende Beweismittel eingereicht:\n\nD3  : WO 2004/058247A1\n\nDie Einspruchsabteilung kam zu folgendem Ergebnis:\n\na) Der gemäß dem Hauptantrag beanspruchte Gegenstand des Patents ging nicht über den Inhalt der ursprünglich eingereichten Anmeldung hinaus.\n\nb) Ein Nachweis, dass das beanspruchte Verfahren nicht ausführbar war, lag nicht vor.\n\nc) Der Anspruchsgegenstand des Hauptantrags war neu.\n\nd) Nächstliegender Stand der Technik war Dokument D3. Der Unterschied des Anspruchsgegenstandes zu D3 betraf die Definition der Trocknungszeit und Temperatur sowie die Definition des Wirkstoffes in Form einer festen Lösung.\n\nDie Aufgabe war in der Verhinderung der Kristallisation von Rotigotin aus einer Polymermatrix, die das Rotigotin als feste Lösung enthält und eine gute Wirkstofffreisetzung zeigt, zu sehen. Kein Dokument im Stand der Technik wies auf die Stabilisierung durch die definierte Trocknung in Zusammenhang mit dem Vorliegen einer festen Lösung des Rotigotins hin.\n\nDer Anspruchsgegenstand des Hauptantrags beinhaltete somit eine erfinderische Tätigkeit.\n\nIII. Mit ihrer Beschwerdeerwiderung reichte die Beschwerdegegnerin (Patentinhaberin) als Hauptantrag den gleichen Anspruchssatz ein, der auch der angefochtenen Entscheidung zugrunde lag.\n\nIV. Die Kammer lud die Beteiligten mit der Ladung vom 7. Mai 2021 zu einer mündlichen Verhandlung.\n\nIn ihrer Mitteilung gemäß Artikel 15 (1) VOBK 2020 stellte die Kammer in Frage, ob aus der ursprünglichen Anmeldung für den Fachmann unmittelbar und eindeutig das Verfahren hervor geht, in dem die feste Lösung des Rotigotins in dem matrixbildenden Polymer bereits in der ausgestrichenen und bei der mit erhöhter Temperatur zu trocknenden Beschichtungsmasse vorliegt.\n\nV. Mit dem Schreiben vom 27. Mai 2021 nahm die Einsprechende 02 ihren Einspruch zurück.\n\nDie Beschwerdeführerin 01 kündigte in ihrer Eingabe vom 6. Dezember 2021 an, nicht an der mündlichen Verhandlung teilzunehmen.\n\nVI. Die mündliche Verhandlung wurde am 14. Januar 2022  als Videokonferenz durchgeführt.\n\nVII. Die für die vorliegende Entscheidung relevanten Argumente der Beschwerdeführerinnen lassen sich wie folgt zusammenfassen:\n\nDie anspruchsgemäß definierte Trocknung der lösungsmittelhaltigen Beschichtungsmasse, in der das Rotigotin als feste Lösung im matrixbildenden Polymer dispergiert ist, gehe über den Inhalt der ursprünglich eingereichten Anmeldung hinaus.\n\nDie ursprüngliche Beschreibung erwähne zwar, dass in einer bevorzugten Ausführungsform der Arzneistoff in Form einer festen Lösung in dem matrixbildenden Polymer dispergiert ist. Es handele sich dabei jedoch um das resultierende getrocknete Produkt und nicht um die noch zu trocknende lösungsmittelenthaltende Beschichtungsmasse. Dies gehe daraus hervor, dass laut der ursprünglichen Beschreibung die Beschichtungsmasse als Lösung oder Suspension zur Beschichtung auf einer Unterlage ausgestrichen wird. Erst durch Entfernung des Lösungsmittels während der Trocknung bilde sich die bevorzugte feste Lösung, in der gemäß der Definition der festen Lösung der ursprünglichen Beschreibung das Rotigotin in Form einer molekular-dispersen Verteilung vorliegt. Dementsprechend würden auch die Beispiele der ursprünglich eingereichten Anmeldung die auszustreichende und zu trocknende Beschichtungsmasse als Dispersion bezeichnen.\n\nVIII. Die für die vorliegende Entscheidung relevanten Argumente der Beschwerdegegnerin lassen sich wie folgt zusammenfassen:\n\nDie ursprünglich eingereichte Anmeldung erwähne ausdrücklich, dass der Arzneistoff bevorzugt in Form einer festen Lösung in dem matrixbildenden Polymer dispergiert ist. Aus der ursprünglich eingereichten Anmeldung gehe auf keiner Weise hervor, dass die bevorzugte Ausführungsform bezüglich der festen Lösung nur das finale getrocknete Produkt betreffe.\n\nIn diesem Zusammenhang sei die Definition der festen Lösung in der ursprünglichen Beschreibung maßgebend, wonach es sich um eine molekular-disperse Verteilung des Arzneistoffs im Matrixpolymer handele. Eine solche Verteilung herrsche bereits in der Beschichtungsmasse im Vorratsbehälter vor, weil auch in diesem Stadium das Polymer die gelösten Rotigotinmoleküle allseitig umgebe. Zudem würden die beschriebenen gängigen Lösungsmittel bereits beim Ausgießen der Beschichtungsmasse verdampfen, wodurch in der ausgestrichenen Beschichtungsmasse die Rotigotinmoleküle zwangsläufig nicht mehr von Lösungsmittelmolekülen, sondern von verbleibenden Polymermolekülen umgeben seien.\n\nDie anspruchsgemäß definierte Trocknung der lösungsmittelhaltigen Beschichtungsmasse, in der das Rotigotin als feste Lösung im matrixbildenden Polymer dispergiert ist, gehe somit nicht über den Inhalt der ursprünglich eingereichten Anmeldung hinaus.\n\nIX. Die Beschwerdeführerinnen 01 und 03 beantragten, die angefochtene Entscheidung aufzuheben und das Patent in vollem Umfang zu widerrufen.\n\nX. Die Beschwerdegegnerin beantragte die Beschwerden zurückzuweisen und das Patent mit den der Beschwerdeerwiderung beigefügten Ansprüchen, die auch der Entscheidung zugrunde lagen, aufrechtzuerhalten.",
         "Entscheidungsgründe\n\n1. Die ursprünglich eingereichte Anmeldung beschreibt ein Verfahren zur Verhinderung der Kristallisation eines Arzneistoffs in einem Polymerfilm, in dem eine ausgestrichene lösungsmittelenthaltende Beschichtungsmasse, umfassend ein matrixbildendes Polymer oder Polymergemisch sowie den Arzneistoff, bei Temperaturen getrocknet wird, die zeitweise mindestens 10°C über der Schmelztemperatur des Arzneistoffs liegen (siehe Seite 5 Zeilen 19-24 und Seite 5 Zeile 30 bis Seite 6 Zeile 6; siehe auch Anspruch 1).\n\nDie ursprünglich eingereichte Anmeldung erwähnt für die definierte zeitweilige Trocknung bei Temperaturen von mindestens 10°C über der Schmelztemperatur des Arzneistoffs liegen bevorzugten Zeitspannen (siehe Ansprüchen 4 und 5) und einen bevorzugten Temperaturbereich (siehe Seite 6 Zeilen 8-11). Außerdem wird Rotigotin nebst Fentanyl als besonders bevorzugter Wirkstoff erwähnt (siehe Seite 8 Zeilen 4-6) und auch beispielsgemäß verwendet.\n\nDer ursprünglich eingereichten Anmeldung zufolge werden die arzneistoffhaltigen Polymerfilme üblicherweise hergestellt, indem mindestens ein Arzneistoff und gegebenenfalls weitere Hilfsstoffe einer Lösung oder Suspension des matrixbildenden Polymers oder Polymergemisches zugesetzt werden. Die erhaltene Beschichtungsmasse wird auf einer folienförmigen Unterlage zu einer Beschichtung mit definierter Dicke ausgestrichen und die beschichtete Unterlage wird anschließend durch einen Trockenkanal geführt, in dem das Lösungsmittel oder Lösungsmittelgemisch bei erhöhter Temperatur entfernt wird, so dass nur noch geringe Restemengen an Lösungsmittel, maximal 0,5 Gew.-%, in der Beschichtung zurückbleiben (siehe Seite 6 Zeile 30 bis Seite 7 Zeile 6)\n\nDie Beispiele 1 und 2 der ursprünglich eingereichten Anmeldung (siehe Seite 8 Zeilen 8-29 und Seite 9 Zeilen 10-26) beziehen sich auf eine zweiphasige Beschichtungsmasse bestehend aus einer Dispersion, bei der in der äußeren Phase ein Polysiloxankleber in n-Heptan und in der inneren Phase Rotigotin und Polyvinylpyrrolidon in Ethanol gelöst vorliegen. Es wird die Trocknung der Beschichtung in einem Trockenkanal mit den folgenden Temperaturprofilen beschrieben:\n\nin Beispiel 1 zum Vergleich:\n\nFORMEL/TABELLE/GRAPHIK\n\nund in Beispiel 2 für die Erfindung:\n\nFORMEL/TABELLE/GRAPHIK\n\nDie ursprünglich eingereichte Anmeldung beschreibt eine bevorzugte Ausführungsform wie folgt:\n\n\"In einer bevorzugten Ausführungsform ist der Arzneistoff in Form einer festen Lösung in dem matrixbildenden Polymer dispergiert. Unter \"fester Lösung\" wird eine molekular-disperse Verteilung des Arzneistoffs im Matrixpolymer verstanden.\" (siehe Seite 7 Zeilen 8-12).\n\n2. Anspruch 1 des vorliegenden Antrags der Beschwerdegegnerin bezieht auf ein Verfahren zur Verhinderung der Kristallisation des Arzneistoffs Rotigotin in einem Polymerfilm, in dem eine ausgestrichene lösungsmittelhaltige Beschichtungsmasse, in der Rotigotin als Arzneistoff in Form einer festen Lösung in einem matrixbildenden Polymer dispergiert ist, unter spezifischen definierten Voraussetzungen getrocknet wird. Neben der Definition des Arzneistoffs Rotigotin und den spezifischen Trocknungsbedingungen unterscheidet sich der vorliegende Anspruchs 1 vom ursprünglich eingereichten Anspruch 1 durch die Definition der festen Lösung des Rotigotins in der zu trocknenden lösungsmittelhaltigen Beschichtungsmasse.\n\nDie einzige Passage der ursprünglich eingereichten Anmeldung, die den Arzneistoff in Form einer festen Lösung in dem matrixbildenden Polymer beschreibt, betrifft den zitierten Abschnitt auf Seite 7, Zeilen 8-12.\n\nDieser Abschnitt beschreibt zwar explizit eine bevorzugte Ausführungsform, in der der Arzneistoff in Form einer festen Lösung vorliegt, jedoch bezieht sich dieser Abschnitt nicht ausdrücklich auf die noch zu trocknende ausgestrichene Beschichtungsmasse.\n\nFür die Beurteilung des vorliegenden Anspruchs 1 hinsichtlich des Erfordernisses des Artikels 123(2) EPÜ stellt sich somit die Frage, ob sich dennoch aus der ursprünglichen Anmeldung unmittelbar und eindeutig das beanspruchte Verfahren ableiten lässt, in dem die feste Lösung des Rotigotins in dem matrixbildenden Polymer bereits in der ausgestrichenen und bei den erhöhten Temperatur zu trocknenden Beschichtungsmasse vorliegt.\n\n3. Die Beschwerdegegnerin hat argumentiert, dass die beschriebene Beschichtungsmasse bereits vor dem Ausstreichen der Definition einer festen Lösung gemäß der ursprünglichen Anmeldung entspricht, weil schon in der Beschichtungsmasse im Vorratsbehälter das Polymer die gelösten Rotigotinmoleküle allseitig umgibt.\n\nDie Kammer stellt jedoch fest, das die ursprünglich eingereichte Anmeldung die feste Lösung als eine molekular-disperse Verteilung des Arzeistoffs im Matrixpolymer definiert. Diese Definition entspricht dem gängigen Verständnis einer festen Lösung, in der ein oder mehrere Feststoffe, wie zum Beispiel ein Arzneistoff, in einem oder mehreren weiteren Feststoffen, wie zum Beispiel einem matixbildenden Polymer, gelöst vorliegen. Die von der Beschwerdegegnerin vertretene Auffassung, dass die Definition der festen Lösung gemäß der ursprünglichen Anmeldung auch die noch auszustreichende und somit noch flüssige Beschichtungsmasse umfasst, hält die Kammer für widersprüchlich und deswegen abwegig.\n\n4. Die Beschwerdegegnerin hat außerdem argumentiert, das die in der ursprünglichen Anmeldung beschriebenen gängigen Lösungsmittel bereits beim Ausgießen der Beschichtungsmasse verdampfen und dementsprechend die Rotigotinmoleküle in der ausgestrichenen Beschichtungsmasse zwangsläufig nicht mehr von Lösungsmittelmolekülen, sondern von verbleibenden Polymermolekülen umgeben sind und somit in fester Lösung vorliegen.\n\nDie Kammer weist jedoch darauf hin, dass laut der ursprünglich eingereichten Anmeldung die Trocknung der lösungsmittelhaltigen ausgestrichenen Beschichtungsmasse üblicherweise in einem Trockenkanal durchgeführt wird, wobei das Lösungsmittel oder Lösungsmittelgemisch bei erhöhter Temperatur entfernt wird, so dass nur noch geringe Restemengen an Lösungsmittel in der Beschichtung zurückbleiben (siehe die oben in Abschnitt 1 erwähnte Passage auf Seite 6 Zeile 30 bis Seite 7 Zeile 6). Dementsprechend wird gemäß den Beispielen eine zweiphasigen Beschichtungsmasse ausgestrichen und anschließend die Trocknung in einem Trockenkanal vorgenommen. In diesem Zusammenhang ist von einer mit der trocknungsbedingten Entfernung des Lösungsmittels einhergehenden Verfestigung der Beschichtungsmasse auszugehen. Damit lässt sich jedoch aus der ursprünglich eingereichten Anmeldung keineswegs ableiten, dass sich durch eine Verdampfung des Lösungsmittel bereits beim Ausstreichen der Beschichtung und noch vor der beschriebenen Entfernung des Lösungsmittel während der Trocknung bei erhöhter Temperatur zwangsläufig eine feste Lösung des Rotigotins im Polymer ergibt.\n\nDas gemäß dem vorliegenden Anspruch 1 beanspruchte Verfahren, in dem die feste Lösung des Rotigotins in dem matrixbildenden Polymer bereits in der ausgestrichenen und bei der mit erhöhter Temperatur zu trocknenden Beschichtungsmasse vorliegt, geht somit nicht unmittelbar und eindeutig aus der ursprünglichen Anmeldung hervor.\n\n5. Die Kammer kommt dementsprechend zu dem Schluss, dass Anspruch 1 des vorliegenden Antrags der Beschwerdegegnerin dem Erfordernis des Artikels 123(2) EPÜ nicht genügt und das Patent somit zu widerrufen ist.",

A medicament formulation containing tiotropium or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the treatment of respiratory disorders is wherein said medicament formulation is in dry powder form and is carried and stored in a peelable blister strip and is administered by dry powder inhaler characterized in that :\n\n each blister cavity is filled up to 70 to 100% of the total volume and is administered\n\n each blister has a cavity volume of 22 to 23 mm**(3).\"\n\n\"10. Use of tiotropium or a pharmaceutically acceptable for the preparation of a medicament formulation in dry powder form according to any of the preceding claims.\"\n\nII. An opposition was filed under Article 100 (a), (b), (c) EPC on the grounds that its subject-matter lacked novelty and inventive step, was not sufficiently disclosed and extended beyond the content of the application as filed.\n\nIII. The appeal lies from the decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition.\n\nIV. The documents cited during the opposition proceedings included the following:\n\nD2: WO 2006/066908\n\nV. According to the decision under appeal, the claims as granted met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC and the claimed invention was sufficiently disclosed. None of the cited documents directly and unambiguously disclosed a combination of a dry powder comprising tiotropium and the blister as defined in claim 1; therefore, novelty was acknowledged.\n\nWith regard to inventive step, D2 was taken as closest prior art document. The claimed solution was not obvious over D2.\n\nVI. The opponent (hereinafter the appellant) filed an appeal against said decision.\n\nA communication from the Board, dated 29 November 2021, was sent to the parties. In it, the Board expressed its preliminary opinion that, inter alia, claim 10 appeared to lack novelty over D2.\n\nVII. Oral proceedings took place by videoconference on 3 March 2022.\n\nVIII. The arguments of the appellant may be summarised as follows:\n\nClaim 10 referred to the use of tiotropium for the preparation of a medicament formulation of any of the preceding claims. Since D2 disclosed medicament formulations according to claim 2 of the opposed patent, wherein tiotropium has been used for preparing said medicament formulations, claim 10 lacked novelty.\n\nIX. The patent proprietor (respondent) did not attend the oral proceedings, as announced by letter of 16 July 2021.\n\nX. Requests\n\nThe appellant requests that the decision of the opposition division be set aside and the patent be revoked. It also requests to set aside the decision of the opposition division to admit document D11 and that documents D14 and D15 be admitted into the proceedings.\n\nThe respondent did not make any request or submission.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. Patent as granted- Novelty\n\n1.1 Claim 10 relates to the use of tiotropium for the preparation of a \"medicament formulation\" in dry powder form \"according to any preceding claims\". Said \"medicament formulation\" is characterized in its broadest definition in the preamble of claim 1 by the presence of tiotropium or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in a dry powder form.\n\nThe remaining features of claim 1, namely \"is carried and stored in a peelable blister strip\", and \"is administered by dry powder inhaler\", as well as the features characterizing the blister filling and volume, are not part of the \"medicament formulation\" of claim 1 and thus are not limiting for the subject-matter of claim 10.\n\n1.2 D2 discloses the use of tiotropium for the preparation of a medicament in dry powder form (see D2, page 42, lines 25-28, page 43, line 21; page 47, line 20; page 49, lines 18 and 23). Said medicament formulation is released from an opened blister pocket to a mouthpiece of a aerosol dispenser for inhalation by a patient (see D2, page 1).\n\nThe above findings were not contested by the respondent, which did not file any substantive submission during the appeal procedure.\n\n1.3 Consequently, the subject-matter of claim 10 lacks novelty over D2, and the patent as granted does not meet the requirements of Article 54 EPC.",

European patent 2 515 887 (hereinafter \"the patent\") was granted on the basis of 13 claims.\n\nClaim 1 of the patent read as follows:\n\n\"A method for stabilizing rotigotine, the method comprising providing a solid dispersion comprising a dispersing agent and a dispersed phase, said dispersing agent comprising at least one silicone pressure sensitive adhesive and said dispersed phase comprising polyvinylpyrrolidone and a non-crystalline form of rotigotine, wherein the weight ratio of rotigotine to polyvinylpyrrolidone is in a range from 9:4 to 9:6, rotigotine is rotigotine free base, and the solubility of rotigotine in the dispersing agent is below 1 w-%.\"\n\nClaim 4 of the patent read as follows:\n\n\"A solid dispersion comprising a dispersing agent and a dispersed phase, said dispersing agent comprising at least one silicone pressure sensitive adhesive and said dispersed phase comprising rotigotine and polyvinylpyrrolidone, wherein the weight ratio of rotigotine to polyvinylpyrrolidone is in a range from 9:4 to 9:6, rotigotine is rotigotine free base, and the solubility of rotigotine in the dispersing agent is below 1 wt-%.\"\n\nII. Two oppositions were filed against the patent on the grounds that its subject-matter lacked novelty and inventive step, it was not sufficiently disclosed and it extended beyond the content of the application as filed.\n\nIII. The opposition division took the interlocutory decision that, on the basis of auxiliary request 2, the patent met the requirements of the EPC. The decision was based on the patent as granted as the main request, on auxiliary request 1 filed on 18 November 2020 and on auxiliary request 2 filed on 18 March 2020.\n\nIV. The decision of the opposition division cited among others the following documents:\n\nD1: US2009/0299304\n\nD2: US2005/0260254\n\nD3: WO03/092677\n\nD8: US2005/0079206\n\nD10: EP0737066\n\nD13: Analytical development report - Tg\n\nV. With regard to the main request (patent as granted), the opposition division decided as follows:\n\n(a) It complied with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, of sufficiency of disclosure and of novelty.\n\n(b) However, it did not comply with Article 56 EPC.\n\nD2 represented the closest prior art. The subject-matter of claim 1 differed from D2 in that the solubility of rotigotine in the dispersing agent was below 1 wt%. The problem was the provision of an alternative method for stabilizing rotigotine in a solid dispersion. The claimed solution did not involve an inventive step because the solubility of rotigotine in the dispersing agent was arbitrarily selected.\n\nVI. The patent proprietors (appellants P) and opponent 1 (appellant O1) each lodged an appeal against the interlocutory decision of the opposition division.\n\nVII. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, appellants P defended their case on the basis of the patent as granted as the main request, and filed auxiliary requests 1-10.\n\nVIII. The Board set out its preliminary opinion in a communication under Article 15(1) RPBA.\n\nIX. Oral proceedings were held before the Board on 28 October 2022. During the oral proceedings, appellant O1 withdrew the objections against the main request under Article 123(2), 83 and 54 EPC.\n\nX. Appellant O1's arguments regarding inventive step can be summarised as follows:\n\n(a) Starting from D1\n\nD1 disclosed a transdermal drug delivery system having an adhesive layer comprising in particular an adhesive, the therapeutic agent in amorphous form and a polymeric stabilizing and a dispersing agent (see paragraphs [0002] and [0020]). The polymeric stabilizer was most preferably PVP (see paragraph [0049]). The adhesive material was most preferably a polysiloxane (see paragraph [0044]). Paragraph [0063] indicated that rotigotine was used in a stabilizer : rotigotine weight ratio of 0.5:1 (4.5:9) or greater. The reference to \"rotigotine\" in this passage meant rotigotine free base. Furthermore, the solubility of rotigotine in the dispersing agent in D1 was necessarily the same as in the patent, namely below 1 wt%, because the same silicone (polysiloxane) dispersing agent was used.\n\nTo the extent that the feature \"the solubility of rotigotine in the dispersing agent is below 1 wt%\" was not shown in D1, no technical effect had been shown to arise from this difference. The objective technical problem was to provide an alternative solid dispersion of rotigotine. The claimed solubility in the dispersing agent was an arbitrarily selected feature. Hence the claimed subject-matter was obvious.\n\n(b) Starting from D2\n\nStarting from formulation 20011036 of D2, the subject-matter of claim 4 differed in that the solubility of rotigotine in the dispersing agent was below 1 wt%. No technical effect had been shown to arise from this difference. The objective technical problem starting from document D2 was the provision of an alternative solid dispersion of rotigotine. The solubility of rotigotine in the dispersing agent defined in claim 4 had been arbitrarily selected, and therefore could not confer an inventive step. Furthermore, D2 neither taught away from using the solvent-based technology known from D1, nor indicated that a dispersing agent with a solubility for rotigotine below 1 wt% would be incompatible with the hot melt technology used in D2.\n\n(c) Starting from D3 or D8\n\nD3 and D8 disclosed transdermal therapeutic systems produced by a solvent-based process and containing rotigotine free base, PVP and a silicone pressure-sensitive adhesive, wherein the rotigotine to PVP weight ratio was 9:3 or 9:2 (see examples 2 and 4 or D3, and Invention Example 1 of D8).\n\nThe subject-matter of claim 4 of the main request differed from the teaching of D3 and D8 in terms of:\n\n- the weight ratio of rotigotine to PVP in the range from 9:4 to 9:6, and\n\n- the solubility in the dispersing agent below 1 wt%.\n\nNo effect had been shown for the solubility feature. As to the rotigotine to PVP ratio, the contested patent essentially found that a higher relative amount of rotigotine favored crystallization, whereas as lower relative amount of rotigotine lead to insufficient drug release.\n\nEven if the problem starting from D3 or D8 was seen in the provision of a transdermal therapeutic system with reduced crystallization tendency and sufficient drug release, the claimed solution was obvious. Since PVP was a known crystallization inhibitor, it was obvious for the skilled person to increase the amount of PVP in  relation to rotigotine in order to reduce the tendency for crystallization. Furthermore, both D1 and D2 disclosed rotigotine to PVP weight ratios as claimed without reporting any insufficient drug release or crystallization problems. Hence, the claimed subject-matter did not involve an inventive step.\n\nXI. The arguments of appellants P regarding inventive step can be summarised as follows:\n\n(a) Starting from D1\n\nThe claimed subject-matter differed from the teaching of D1 at least in the solubility of rotigotine in the dispersing agent of below 1 wt.-% and the use of rotigotine free base with a rotigotine to PVP weight ratio of 9:4 to 9:6. In particular, paragraph [0063] of D1 as such left open whether rotigotine free base or a salt thereof was meant. To be consistent with the general teaching of D1 (especially paragraphs [0030] and [0031]), paragraph [0063] necessarily related to rotigotine HCl having a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 76°C (see D13), and thus did not disclose a rotigotine free base to stabilizing weight ratio of 9:4 to 9:6 as defined in claim 1. Furthermore, there was no basis for concluding that any silicone or polysiloxane covered by the general definition of the adhesive material in paragraph [0044] of D1 had a solubility of rotigotine free base below 1 wt%.\n\nThe objective technical problem was the provision of an improved transdermal therapeutic system containing rotigotine as active ingredient preventing rotigotine from crystallization and providing for a sufficient drug release.\n\nThe claimed solution was not obvious for the skilled person, because D1 taught away from a rotigotine free base to PVP ratio of 9:4 to 9:6. Based on the low Tg of rotigotine free base, D1 called for a therapeutic agent to stabilizing agent ratio of 0.5 or less.\n\n(b) Starting from D2\n\nThe claimed subject-matter differed from formulation example 20011036 of D2 by the solubility of rotigotine in the dispersing agent of below 1 wt.-% and the production of the claimed transdermal therapeutic system by a solvent-based process. The objective technical problem was the provision of an alternative albeit stable solid dispersion of rotigotine as part of a transdermal therapeutic system characterized by suitable drug release properties.\n\nThe claimed solution was not obvious because D2 not only advocated the preparation of hot melt patches, but also expressly taught away from the use of a solvent-based transdermal therapeutic system as a simple replacement of the hot melt-based systems described therein. Hot melt and solvent-based processes were two different technologies, which could not be used interchangeably for preparing the adhesive matrix of a transdermal patch. In particular, the plain silicone adhesives used in the claimed transdermal therapeutic system were not hot-meltable.\n\n(c) Starting from D3 or D8\n\nD3 and D8 disclosed the preparation of a rotigotine patch via a solvent-based process, using a rotigotine to PVP weight ratio of 9:3 or 9:2 (see example 4 of D3 or invention example 1 of D8). Starting from D3 or D8, the distinguishing feature was the rotigotine to PVP weight ratio of 9:4 to 9:6. The objective technical problem was to provide an improved transdermal therapeutic system containing rotigotine as active ingredient preventing rotigotine from crystallization and providing for a sufficient drug release. Neither D3 nor D8 provided a pointer to the claimed solution. No incentive was to be found in D1 or D2 either. In particular, the method of D1 was predicated on a correlation between the Tg of the therapeutic agent and the amount of crystallization inhibitor. Thus, D1 taught away from the claimed rotigotine free base to PVP ratio of 9:4 to 9:6.\n\nXII. Appellants P request that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be maintained as granted, or, alternatively, that the patent be maintained on the basis of one of auxiliary requests 1-10 filed with the grounds of appeal.\n\nXIII. Appellant O1 requests that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be revoked in its entirety.\n\nXIV. Respondent O2 (opponent 2) made no request during the appeal proceedings.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\nMain request (patent as granted), inventive step\n\n1. Following appellant O1's withdrawal, at the oral proceedings, of the objections of added subject-matter, insufficiency of disclosure and lack of novelty, the sole issue to be addressed is inventive step. In the following, inventive step is assessed for the subject-matter of claim 4, which is the broadest claim of the main request.\n\nThe invention seeks to address the problems of stabilizing a solid dispersion of non-crystalline rotigotine for use in the preparation of a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) having increased long term storage stability due to the reduced formation of rotigotine crystals (see paragraph [0001] of the patent). To solve these problems, the claimed solid dispersion comprises a dispersed phase comprising PVP and rotigotine free base in defined ratios, and a dispersing agent containing at least one silicone pressure sensitive adhesive and having defined solubility for rotigotine.\n\nAppellant O1 raised objections of lack of inventive step starting alternatively from D1, D2 or D3/D8.\n\n2. Starting from D1\n\n2.1 D1 discloses a solid dispersion transdermal drug delivery system (TTS) including an adhesive layer which comprises an adhesive, a therapeutic agent in amorphous form and a combination polymeric stabilizing and dispersing agent and a protective release liner (see paragraphs [0002] and [0020]). The therapeutic agent is present in a stable amorphous form (i.e. non-crystalline) and forms a solid dispersion with a polymer stabilizer (see paragraph [0051]). The therapeutic agent may, in one of several alternatives, be rotigotine (see paragraphs [0057]-[0068]). The adhesive material is most preferably one or more polysiloxanes (i.e. silicones; see paragraph [0044]). The stabilizer is most preferably polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (i.e. PVP; see paragraph [0049]).\n\nThe weight ratio of the stabilizing agent to rotigotine is 0.5 or greater, or, in other words, the weight ratio of rotigotine to stabilizing agent is 9:4.5 or lower (see paragraph [063]).\n\nThus, D1 discloses a TTS solid dispersion comprising one or more polysiloxanes as adhesive material, PVP as stabilizer, and rotigotine, with a rotigotine : stabilizer weight ratio of 9:4.5 or lower.\n\n2.2 However, for the following reasons, D1 neither discloses this ratio in combination with the use of rotigotine free base, nor that the solubility of rotigotine in the dispersing agent is below 1 wt%.\n\n2.2.1 Firstly, D1 does not explicitly disclose that \"the solubility of rotigotine in the dispersing agent is below 1 wt%\".\n\nAppellant O1's position is that, if the solubility of rotigotine in a silicone dispersing agent is below 1 wt% according to the contested patent, then the same must be true for the same material (polysiloxane adhesive) in D1.\n\nThe Board does not share this position. There is no indication, in the patent or otherwise, that all silicones or polysiloxane adhesives generally stated in paragraph [0044] of D1 are characterized by a solubility for rotigotine free base below 1 wt%. In the patent, the formulation examples (see the examples and table 1) contain specific silicone adhesives as dispersing agent, namely a mixture of the Dow Corning silicone adhesives BIO-PSA Q7-4301 and 4201. In contrast, D1 neither discloses the claimed solubility, nor specific polysiloxane adhesives (such as those exemplified in the patent) leading implicitly to this solubility.\n\n2.2.2 Secondly, paragraph [0063] of D1 does not disclose the rotigotine : PVP ratio of 9:4.5 in the context of rotigotine free base.\n\nD1 generally indicates that the \"references to the therapeutic agents also include their salts\" (see paragraph [0053]). In light of this general indication, the mention of rotigotine in paragraph [0063] cannot be assumed to refer specifically to the free base, but must be regarded as being unspecific as to which form of rotigotine is meant.\n\n2.2.3 Furthermore, D1 discloses that \"if the therapeutic agent has a low glass transition temperature, the weight ratio of the polymeric material to the amorphous form of a therapeutic agent required to disperse the amorphous form of the therapeutic agent is 2 or greater\", a low glass transition temperature (Tg) being less than 50° C (see paragraph [0030]). Thus D1 indicates that, if the therapeutic agent (here: rotigotine) has a low Tg, a weight ratio of polymeric stabilizing/dispersing agent (here: PVP) to rotigotine of at least 2 is not just preferable, but mandatory to obtain a dispersion. A weight ratio of PVP to rotigotine of at least 2 corresponds to a rotigotine : PVP ratio below 9:18, which is outside the claimed range of 9:4 to 9:6.\n\nAppellant O1 points out that the weight ratio of polymeric stabilizing/dispersing agent to therapeutic agent in D1 is generally at least 0.5 according to claims 2 and 14 of D1. However, in the Board's view, the broad definition of the invention in claims 2 and 14 of D1 does not lead to a different reading of D1. This broad definition covers both alternatives, namely a polymer : therapeutic agent ratio above 0.5 for high Tg therapeutic agents, and above 2 for low Tg therapeutic agents. However it does not imply that a ratio of 0.5 is possible in the specific case of low Tg therapeutic agents. This is also not derivable from paragraphs [0058]-[0060] of D1, since these passages are limited to different therapeutic agents (namely scopolamine, oxybutynin or naltrexone). On the contrary, paragraph [0057] reiterates that therapeutic agents with lower Tg \"require an increased amount of stabilizing agent, by weight, to disperse and stabilize the therapeutic agent\" (i.e. in a ratio of 2 or greater).\n\n2.2.4 As shown in D13, rotigotine free base has a low Tg of 9° C (see section 5). Accordingly, the disclosure in paragraph [0063] of D1, relating to a weight ratio of stabilizing agent to rotigotine of 0.5, is not only unspecific as to the form of rotigotine referred to (i.e. salt or free base), but is in fact incompatible with rotigotine free base having a low Tg. This passage is rather consistent with a form of rotigotine with a high Tg (see paragraph [0031] of D1), such as a rotigotine salt. Rotigotine HCl for instance has a Tg=76° C (see D13).\n\n2.3 The Board comes to the conclusion that, even if the problem to be solved is the provision of an alternative solid dispersion of rotigotine, an inventive step is to be acknowledged, because the skilled person, starting from D1, would not consider the use of rotigotine free base in combination with the claimed rotigotine : stabilizer weight ratio.\n\nAs explained above (see 2.2.3), in D1 (see paragraph [0030]), a ratio polymeric material : therapeutic agent of 2 or greater, corresponding to a rotigotine : PVP ratio of 9:18 or lower, is \"required\" for therapeutic agents with low Tg, e.g. less than 50°C. The combination of rotigotine free base (having a low Tg) with the much higher ratio of from 9:4 to 9:6 is thus not compatible with the teaching of D1.\n\n2.4 Accordingly, the skilled person, starting from D1, would not consider a rotigotine : PVP ratio of 9:4-9:6 in combination with the use of rotigotine free base as an obvious solution to the problem.\n\n3. Starting from D2\n\n3.1 D2 is concerned with the provision of a TTS encompassing a rotigotine containing adhesive matrix. TTS Formulation 20011036 of D2 (see page 10, table 1) is a solid dispersion comprising a silicone pressure sensitive adhesive (silicone-based hot melt adhesive containing Bio-PSA 7-4300 Bio adhesive), 10 wt% PVP and 15 wt% free-base rotigotine, hence with a rotigotine : PVP ratio of 9:6.\n\nConsidering the similarity of the general purpose (the preparation of rotigotine TTS) and in terms of features, D2 is a suitable starting point for the assessment of inventive step.\n\n3.2 The subject-matter of claim 4 differs from the TTS formulation 20011036 of D2 in that the solubility of rotigotine in the dispersing agent is below 1 wt%.\n\n3.3 Considering that no effect has been shown to be associated with the differentiating feature, the technical problem starting from D2 is the provision of an alternative solid dispersion of rotigotine.\n\n3.4 The Board agrees with appellant O1 that the claims of the main request are not limited to any particular process for the preparation of the dispersion, and cover both solvent-based or hot-melt processes. The relevant question is however whether the skilled person, starting from D2, would consider using a dispersing agent in which rotigotine (free base) has a solubility below 1 wt%.\n\n3.4.1 The crux of D2 is to avoid the drawbacks associated with solvent-based processes, and in particular to allow for larger amounts of rotigotine. To this end, D2 proposes a TTS with a rotigotine-containing adhesive matrix, characterized in that the adhesive matrix is produced in a hot-melting process, whereby the adhesive matrix contains a hot-meltable adhesive in which rotigotine is dispersed and partly or completely dissolved (see paragraphs [0010] and [0018]). In the Board's view, the skilled person, starting from D2, would not realistically take a step back and consider solvent-based processes. Hence the skilled person starting from D2 would consider the use of dispersing agents only to the extent that they are compatible with the hot-melt process of D2.\n\n3.4.2 In this respect, D2 requires the use of specific hot-meltable dispersing agents (see paragraphs [0052]-[0055]) in which rotigotine is partly or completely dissolved. This statement must be read in the context of the purpose of D2, which is to allow for higher charges of rotigotine such as up to over 40%. In particular, the chosen starting point (formulation 20011036 of D2) contains 15 wt% rotigotine. Accordingly, the skilled person is explicitly instructed by the starting point D2 not to choose dispersing agents with a low solubility for rotigotine, and would be deterred from choosing a dispersing agent with a solubility for rotigotine below 1 wt%.\n\nContrary to appellant O1's opinion, there is no indication that the skilled person could regard a dispersing agent in which rotigotine has a solubility below 1 wt% as compatible with these limitations set in D2. Appellant O1 referred to paragraphs [0139]-[0141] of D2, which allow for the adhesive matrix to contain 50-99 wt% of hot-meltable adhesive and 1-40 wt% rotigotine. However, even if this broad disclosure covers, at one end-point, the presence of rotigotine in an amount of 1 wt% in the adhesive matrix, it does not mean that this low amount of 1 wt% rotigotine could be only partially soluble in the matrix.\n\nAccordingly, the skilled person, starting from D2, would not consider the use of a dispersing agent with a solubility for rotigotine below 1 wt% as an obvious solution to the problem.\n\n4. Starting from D3 or D8\n\nBoth D3 (see examples 2 and 4 on pages 15-16 and 20-22) and D8 (see Invention example 1 on page 4) show TTSs containing rotigotine free base, PVP and at least one silicone pressure-sensitive adhesive, wherein the rotigotine : PVP ratio is 9:3 or 9:2. The compositions of D3 and D8 correspond to the (comparative) 9:2 composition of the patent (see table 1) and use the same mixture of BIO-PSA® Q7-4301 and 07-4201 as dispersing agent.\n\nThe sole distinguishing feature is the rotigotine to PVP weight ratio of 9:4 to 9:6.\n\nAccording to the appellants P, the technical effect resulting from this difference is an improvement in stability in combination with an unchanged drug release. In the Board's view, this effect is supported by the experimental data of the patent (see paragraph [0129] and table 3): increasing the amount of PVP to a rotigotine : PVP ratio of 9:4 or 9:6 prevents the crystallization of rotigotine which occurs for a ratio of 9:2. At the same time, the drug release profiles for ratios of 9:4 and 9:6 remain similar to, or better than, those for ratios of 9:2 and 9:3 (see figure 1 and paragraph [0142]).\n\nAccordingly, the objective technical problem is the provision of an improved transdermal therapeutic system containing rotigotine as active ingredient preventing rotigotine from crystallization and providing for a sufficient drug release.\n\nAppellant O1 considers that the claimed solution is obvious in light of D1 or D2, or taking into account the known properties of PVP. The Board does not concur and considers that the skilled person could not expect that the claimed subject-matter would solve the above problem. In D1, a rotigotine : stabilizer ratio within the claimed range of 9:4-9:6 is not considered in the context of rotigotine free base (see 2.2.4 above). In D2, a rotigotine : PVP ratio of 9:6 is shown in the context of hot-meltable dispersing agents, and is not associated with the improvement observed in the patent. Lastly, PVP is known as a crystallization inhibitor for transdermal preparations, but is also known to be detrimental to other properties such as permeation rates for delivery (see D10, paragraphs [0008] and [0017]). Hence, the skilled person would not expect that the release profile would remain satisfactory.\n\nIn conclusion, the main request meets the requirement of inventive step.",

By the interlocutory decision dated 28 January 2022 in consolidated proceedings T 1513/17 and T 2719/19 (the \"referring decision\", published in OJ EPO 2022, A92), Technical Board of Appeal 3.3.04 (the \"referring board\") referred, on the basis of Article 112(1)(a) EPC, the following questions of law (the \"referred questions\") to the Enlarged Board of Appeal (the \"Enlarged Board\") for decision:\n\nI. Does the EPC confer jurisdiction on the EPO to determine whether a party validly claims to be a successor in title as referred to in Article 87(1)(b) EPC?\n\nII. If question I is answered to the affirmative\n\nCan a party B validly rely on the priority right claimed in a PCT-application for the purpose of claiming priority rights under Article 87(1) EPC\n\nin the case where\n\n1) a PCT-application designates party A as applicant for the US only and party B as applicant for other designated States, including regional European patent protection and\n\n2) the PCT-application claims priority from an earlier patent application that designates party A as the applicant and\n\n3) the priority claimed in the PCT-application is in compliance with Article 4 of the Paris Convention?\n\nThe patent and the opposition proceedings underlying appeal T 1513/17\n\n2. European patent application No. 05 779 924.9, published as international application WO 2005/110481 with the filing date of 16 May 2005 (the \"PCT application\"), claims priority of the US provisional patent application No. 60/571,444, filed on 14 May 2004 (the \"priority application\"). The priority application was filed in the name of R.P. Rother, H. Wang and Z. Zhong, the inventors. The PCT application names the three inventors as inventors and as applicants for the United States of America (US) only. For all designated States except the US, it names Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the University of Western Ontario as applicants. European patent No. 1 755 674 (the \"patent in suit\"), was granted on the basis of application 05 779 924.9 on 19 November 2014. Since the University of Western Ontario had assigned their right to the patent application to Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2007, the patent in suit names the latter as the sole patent proprietor (the \"patent proprietor\", later the \"appellant\") and R.P. Rother, H. Wang and Z. Zhong as inventors.\n\n3. The patent in suit was revoked after opposition proceedings instituted by Novartis AG (\"opponent 1\", later \"respondent I\") and F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG together with Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (jointly, \"opponent 2\", later \"respondent II\"). The grounds of opposition included lack of novelty over the disclosure in documents D10, D20 and D21, all published after the filing date of the priority application but prior to the filing date of the patent in suit. The validity of the priority claim was contested, inter alia because the applicants, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the University of Western Ontario were alleged not to be the applicants or the successors in title of the applicants of the priority application.\n\n4. The priority right was found to be invalid because only the priority right of one of the three inventors had been assigned to the patent proprietor. An assignment of the other two inventors to the patent proprietor or to the University of Western Ontario had not taken place prior to the filing of the PCT application. As a consequence of the invalid priority right, the opposition division found, inter alia, that claim 1 of the main request lacked novelty over D20 and D21.\n\nThe patent application and the examination proceedings underlying appeal T 2719/19\n\n5. European patent application No. 16 160 321.2 (the \"application in suit\") was filed as a divisional application of an earlier divisional application derived from application EP 05 779 924.9 (the application to the patent in suit). Based on the same PCT application as the patent in suit, the application in suit also claimed priority from US provisional application No. 60/571,444, referred to above in the context of appeal case T 1513/17 as the \"priority application\".\n\n6. During the examination proceedings, the same issues concerning the priority claim were invoked as in the opposition proceedings concerning the patent in suit (see above points 3 and 4). The same documents D20 and D21 as used in the opposition proceedings concerning the patent in suit were invoked against the subject-matter of the application in suit. For the same reasons as in the opposition proceedings underlying T 1513/17, the priority was found to be invalid. Consequently, the application in suit was refused because intermediate publications D20 and D21 were found to be novelty-destroying prior art.\n\nAppeal proceedings and referring decision\n\n7. Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as applicant of the refused application in suit and proprietor of the revoked patent in suit, filed appeals (ex-parte appeal T 2719/19 and inter partes appeal T 1513/17) allocated to the same board of appeal. In both cases, the appellant argued that the priority right derived from the priority application was valid and documents D20 and D21 were thus not prior art.\n\n8. The board summoned for oral proceedings on 8 December 2021 for both cases. At the hearing the board decided to deal with both appeal cases in consolidated proceedings pursuant to Article 10(2) RPBA. Both the appellant (in both cases) and respondent II in T 1513/17 requested, inter alia, that questions concerning the validity of priority rights be referred to the Enlarged Board. At the end of the oral proceedings, the chair announced that the board was seriously contemplating referring questions to the Enlarged Board concerning issues related to the entitlement to priority.\n\n9. The referring decision was issued as a joint decision in T 1513/17 and T 2719/19 on 28 January 2022. The board found both appeals to be admissible. A request of the appellant for correction of designation of the applicants for all designated States except the US in form PCT/RO/101 under Rule 139 EPC - which would have resolved the entitlement to priority issue - was not allowed (Reasons, points 4 to 9).\n\n10. The referring decision then discusses the point which is decisive for the board's final decision in both cases, namely the entitlement to priority under the \"joint applicants approach\". As described in the referring decision, the \"joint applicants approach\" concerns, in the most simple case, the situation where a party A is applicant for the priority application and parties A and B are applicants for the later application for which the priority is claimed. In this situation, party B can benefit from the priority right to which its co-applicant A is entitled; a separate transfer of the priority right to party B is not needed according to this approach which was found to be undisputed in the referring decision (Reasons, points 15 and 16, referring to T 1933/12).\n\n11. The appellant argues that the joint applicants approach should not only apply to European patent applications with a plurality of applicants but also to PCT applications having different applicants for different designated States. This approach is referred to in the referring decision as \"PCT joint applicants approach\" (Reasons, point 17). It implies that in a PCT application where parties A and B are applicants for different designated States, both applicants may rely on the priority right derived from a priority application filed by only one of the applicants without the need for any transfer of priority rights from party A to party B.\n\n12. The referring decision noted that the \"PCT joint applicants approach\" was a disputed concept. In accordance with the requests of all parties to the referral case, it was decided to refer \"a question concerning the PCT joint applicants approach\" (referred question II) to the Enlarged Board (Reasons, point 19).\n\n13. The parties further took the position that the questions to the Enlarged Board should include a question regarding the jurisdiction of the EPO to decide on the entitlement to the priority right. The referring board noted that the jurisdiction of the EPO to decide on the entitlement to the priority right had been extensively addressed and supported in T 844/18 while the opposite position was not explicitly taken in appeal decisions but in certain communications of boards in cases that were eventually resolved without taking a decision on the issue of entitlement to priority. Considering that the issue would arise in other cases, the referring board took the opportunity to seek a final decision on the \"jurisdiction issue\" as well (Reasons, point 26; referred question I).\n\nProceedings before the Enlarged Board of Appeal\n\n14. In accordance with Article 8 of the Rules of Procedure of the Enlarged Board of Appeal (RPEBA), the Enlarged Board decided on 21 March 2022 to consider the points of law referred to it by the board in case T 1513/17 (G 1/22) and in case T 2719/19 (G 2/22) in consolidated proceedings.\n\n15. In March 2022, a communication from the Enlarged Board concerning cases G 1/22 and G 2/22 was published (OJ EPO 2022, A36), inviting third parties to file written statements in accordance with Article 10 RPEBA by 29 July 2022. Thirteen amicus curiae briefs were received in response (which were published on the internet website of the Enlarged Board under \"www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/eba.html\"):\n\n(1) Maiwald\n\n(2) Vossius & Partner\n\n(3) Nokia Technologies Oy (represented by Cohausz & Florack)\n\n(4) George W. Schlich\n\n(5) Boehringer Ingelheim\n\n(6) The Broad Institute, Inc. (represented Bird & Bird / Brinkhof)\n\n(7) Peter de Lange\n\n(8) IP Federation\n\n(9) Grund IP Group\n\n(10) efpia - European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations\n\n(11) ipo - Intellectual Property Owners Association\n\n(12) König Szynka Tilmann von Renesse\n\n(13) CIPA - Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys\n\n16. The authors of the amicus curiae briefs can be attributed to the following groups:\n\n(i) independent members of the patent profession (mainly patent attorneys) and associations of such professionals;\n\n(ii) enterprises regularly acting as applicants/patent proprietors and/or as opponents.\n\n17. Many amicus curiae briefs were accompanied by documents previously filed in various appeal proceedings in which transfer of priority was relevant (in particular, expert opinions).\n\n18. After expiry of the time limit for filing amicus curiae briefs, Professor Joseph Straus submitted a letter concerning the referral on 22 August 2022. Further comments were submitted by FICPI in a letter dated 13 October 2022 and in a supplemental amicus curiae brief of Mr Peter de Lange on 27 January 2023.\n\n19. In preparation for the oral proceedings, the Enlarged Board issued a communication on 21 March 2023. Based on the comments received in the referral proceedings, a few questions were formulated which, in the Enlarged Board's view, could help to facilitate the discussion on the merits of the referred questions. All parties as well as the President of the EPO responded to the Enlarged Board's communication on or before 5 May 2023.\n\n20. During oral proceedings held on 26 May 2023, the representatives of all parties and of the President of the EPO addressed the Enlarged Board.\n\nSummary of the stakeholders' positions\n\n21. The parties to the referral case, the President of the EPO as well as most of the amicus curiae took the position that the referral should be admissible. A few amicus curiae briefs (Vossius & Partner, G.W. Schlich, Grund IP Group) questioned the admissibility of question I, mainly because they saw no need to ensure uniform application of the law in view of case law they found to be long-standing and consistent. After the Enlarged Board gave its preliminary view in its communication of 21 March 2023 that the referral should be admitted, neither the parties nor the President of the EPO wished to address the admissibility issue in the oral proceedings.\n\n22. As far as the merits of question I are concerned, the opinions were split. While the appellant, respondent II and the President of the EPO supported an affirmative answer, respondent I - even though in the same procedural position as respondent II - took the clear position that the EPC did not confer jurisdiction to determine whether a party validly claims to be a successor in title as referred to in Article 87(1) EPC. Out of the amicus curiae contributions, about half supported a positive answer while the other half supported a negative answer.\n\n23. The stakeholders supporting the EPO's jurisdiction mainly argued (i) on the basis of legal certainty and uniformity across all Contracting States and (ii) that entitlement to priority concerned a patentability requirement and that the EPC did not foresee any exception from its jurisdiction in this context. The opposite view was mainly supported by the argument that the EPC lacked the conflict of laws rules necessary to determine the applicable national laws relevant for succession. It was also argued, inter alia, that there was no public or third-party interest in the assessment of a succession that has never been challenged by any party involved in the succession and that the assessment of the entitlement to priority was an assessment of entitlement to the patent, or an analogous assessment, which was prohibited under Article 60(3) EPC.\n\n24. Almost all stakeholders who took the position that question II should be answered by the Enlarged Board supported a positive answer. They argued mainly based on the purpose of the priority system, namely, to facilitate international patent protection. In this context, the \"PCT joint applicants approach\" was widely supported but also other lines of reasoning such as the concept of an \"implied transfer\" of priority rights. More emphasis was placed on a benevolent assessment of the applicant's right to priority than on specific legal considerations. For example, CIPA in its amicus curiae brief (point 2.19) wrote that it was \"of the view that it would be beneficial for applicants and proprietors if a generous approach is adopted by the EPO when considering entitlement to priority.\"",
         "REASONS FOR THE DECISION\n\nThe EPC provisions on priority\n\n25. Articles 87 to 89 EPC form Chapter II (titled \"Priority\") of Part III of the EPC. They provide a complete, self-contained code of rules of law on the subject of claiming priority for the purpose of filing a European patent application (G 1/15, OJ EPO 2017, A82, Reasons, point 5.2.3; J 15/80, OJ EPO 1981, 213, Headnote I). Since the EPC constitutes, according to its preamble, a special agreement within the meaning of Article 19 of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (\"Paris Convention\"), the EPC provisions on priority are intended not to contravene the basic principles concerning priority of the Paris Convention (see G 3/93, OJ EPO 1995, 18, Reasons, point 4; G 2/98, OJ EPO 2001, 413, Reasons, point 3).\n\n26. Article 87 as well as Articles 88(2), (3) and (4) EPC pertain to the material conditions under which priority rights may be derived from an earlier application. Article 88(1) EPC concerns the procedural requirements to be met by an applicant desiring to take advantage of the priority of an earlier application, namely the filing of a declaration of priority and other documents with the EPO. These procedural requirements are further specified in the Implementing Regulations (Rules 52 to 54 EPC). Article 89 EPC prescribes the effect of a priority right, i.e. that the priority date shall count as the date of filing of the European patent application for the purposes of the delimitation of the prior art under Articles 54(2) and (3) EPC. In other words, the priority right allows the exclusion of everything that has become prior art between the priority date and the filing date (often referred to as \"intermediate prior art\") for the assessment of patentability.\n\n27. Article 87(1) EPC provides that \"[a]ny person who has duly filed, in or for (a) any State party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property or (b) any Member of the World Trade Organisation, an application for a patent, a utility model or a utility certificate, or his successor in title, shall enjoy, for the purpose of filing a European patent application in respect of the same invention, a right of priority during a period of twelve months from the date of filing of the first application\" (emphasis added). Article 87(1) was amended in the context of EPC 2000, inter alia, by the introduction of the reference to applications filed in a Member of the World Trade Organisation in order to align the provision with the TRIPS Agreement (bullet point (b) in Article 87(1) EPC, see OJ EPO Special Edition 4/2007, p. 88).\n\n28. The \"same invention\" criterion of Article 87(1) EPC (often referred to as \"substantive priority\" or \"substantive validity of the priority\") is regularly an issue in examination and opposition proceedings, and it was underlying two referrals to the Enlarged Board: G 2/98 (OJ EPO 2001, 413) and G 1/15 (OJ EPO 2017, A82). The present referral concerns the question whether the applicant of the later application is entitled to claim the priority of the earlier application, in particular as a successor of the applicant of the priority application (often referred to as \"formal priority\" or formal validity of the priority; for the terminology see e.g. the comments of the President of the EPO of 8 July 2022, footnote 1).\n\n29. Hereafter, to maintain consistency with the referring decision and existing case law (e.g. T 844/18), the application from which priority is claimed (\"first application\" in Article 87(1) EPC, \"previous application\" in Article 88(1) EPC) shall be referred to as the \"priority application\". Any application claiming priority from a priority application shall be referred to as a \"subsequent application\". Accordingly, the respective applicant shall be the \"subsequent applicant\" and the applicant of the priority application the \"priority applicant\".\n\n30. Article 4A(1) Paris Convention provides: \"Any person who has duly filed an application for a patent, or for the registration of a utility model, or of an industrial design, or of a trademark, in one of the countries of the Union, or his successor in title, shall enjoy, for the purpose of filing in the other countries, a right of priority during the periods hereinafter fixed.\" (emphasis added) The extension of the priority entitlement to the successor in title (i.e. the second underlined passage in the quote above) was introduced at the Washington Conference in 1911 (Bodenhausen, Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, Geneva 1968, p. 37). With respect to the definition of the parties entitled to claim priority from an earlier patent application (\"any person who has duly filed an application (...) or his successor in title\"), the provisions of Article 4A(1) Paris Convention and of Article 87(1) EPC are identical.\n\nInterpretation and scope of the referred questions\n\nQuestion I\n\n31. Question I (\"Does the EPC confer jurisdiction on the EPO to determine whether a party validly claims to be a successor in title as referred to in Article 87(1)(b) EPC?\") refers to Article 87(1)(b) EPC only, where reference is made to priority filings in or for Members of the World Trade Organisation. Article 87(1)(a) EPC refers to priority filings in or for States party to the Paris Convention. The \"successor in title\" passage in Article 87(1) EPC is not specific to one of the groups of states referred to in Article 87(1)(a) and (b) EPC. These groups overlap to a large extent, and the legal issues are the same for both groups. Moreover, question II refers to \"claiming priority rights under Article 87(1) EPC\". It is therefore assumed that the reference to sub-paragraph (b) of Article 87(1) EPC in question I is of no relevance.\n\n32. The wording of question I with respect to the jurisdiction of the EPO is clear in that it addresses the competence of the EPO (i.e. of the examining and opposition divisions and also the boards of appeal) to assess the entitlement to claim priority of the party filing the subsequent application.\n\n33. There may be uncertainties about the entitlement to claim priority under Article 87(1) EPC also in cases where not the succession in title but the identity of the person having filed the priority application is in dispute. In T 844/18, concerning a situation where four inventors were applicants of the priority application and only three of them filed the subsequent European application and claimed priority, the board took the position that succession in title was not an issue in this case (see Reasons, point 21). In the Reasons (point 9 and 23) of T 844/18, reference is made to the jurisdiction to examine \"who is entitled to the right of priority\" (Reasons, points 9 and 23). The discussion of the EPO's jurisdiction in T 844/18 consequently encompasses the determination of both the person who filed the priority application and its successor in title. Similar to the facts underlying T 844/18, a legal entity consisting of a plurality of persons or entities (such as a partnership) may be the applicant of a priority application, and the same entity with a changed composition or membership may claim priority from this application. In such situations, it may be difficult to distinguish between the determination of the personal identity between the two applicant entities and the assessment of a succession in title.\n\n34. To cover all situations where the right of an applicant to claim priority is relevant in proceedings before the EPO, question I is rephrased as follows: \"Is the EPO competent to assess whether a party is entitled to claim priority under Article 87(1) EPC?\". As explained in the communication of the Enlarged Board of 21 March 2023, question I refers to the EPO's competence to assess the entitlement to claim priority for the subsequent application and it encompasses all situations where the applicant claiming priority for its subsequent application is not clearly identical with the applicant of the priority application.\n\n35. As has long been pointed out in the discussions on entitlement to priority, the issue of entitlement not only arises with respect to a patent or patent application examined or opposed to in proceedings before the EPO. The issue equally arises with respect to prior art, namely patent documents forming prior art under Article 54(3) EPC and relying on a priority date prior to the effective date of the European patent application or European patent under consideration (see e.g. T 493/06, Reasons, points 1 to 11; T 382/07, Reasons, point 9). Question I is understood to cover both cases; the objection that an applicant was not entitled to claim priority can equally be raised by an opponent (if the priority issue concerns the opposed patent) or by a patent proprietor (if the priority issue concerns a prior art document).\n\nQuestion II\n\n36. Question II is understood to concern proceedings before any instance or department of the EPO where the situation described in question II occurs. According to the referring decision, the question needs to be answered only \"[i]f question I is answered in the affirmative\".\n\n37. The question covers a special situation occurring where a party, typically the inventor(s), files a US priority application (also in the form of a provisional application) which is then used as priority application for a later PCT application designating one party (typically still the inventor(s)) for the US only and another party (typically the employer of the inventor(s)) for regional European patent protection. Before the \"America Invents Act\" (AIA) of 2011 entered into force, only the inventor(s) could be applicants in a US patent application (see e.g. Druschel/Kommer, Die formelle Priorität europäischer Patente, GRUR 2022, 353). The priority application underlying the present referral (filed in 2004) had to be filed by the inventors under the then applying laws.\n\n38. As implied by the referring decision (see Reasons, point 43), the wording of question II is addressing the facts underlying the referral and the \"PCT joint applicants approach\" (see above point 11) in a general way but it is not to be understood as being further limited to specific factual circumstances (e.g. to a number of parties).\n\n39. As pointed out in the referring decision (Reasons, point 18), confusion should be avoided between the \"PCT joint applicants approach\" mentioned above and the \"all applicants approach\" used, for example, in decision T 844/18 (Facts and Submissions, point VIII). In this case, four inventors were applicants of the priority application and only three of them filed the subsequent PCT application (encompassing the European application) and claimed priority. The priority claim failed to meet the requirement that all applicants of the priority application must also be applicants of the subsequent PCT application for which the priority is claimed.\n\n40. The referring decision critically summarises various possible legal bases for the \"PCT joint applicants approach\" (Reasons, points 28 to 39). However, the referring board did not limit its question II to the viability of the \"PCT joint applicants approach\", thereby leaving open the possibility that question II could be answered in the affirmative with another reasoning (for example, by acknowledging that the joint filing of a PCT application is sufficient proof for the validity of the priority claim).\n\n41. As far as the reference to Article 4 of the Paris Convention at the end of question II is concerned, it is understood that this refers to compliance with all provisions of Article 4 Paris Convention except for the entitlement to priority as addressed in Article 4A(1) Paris Convention (see above point 30).\n\n42. The referring decision addresses the conflict of laws rules applicable to the transfer of priority rights, noting that a separate question was not necessary \"because it is inherently contained in the questions posed and it will be addressed in the considerations of the EBA, as needed\" (Reasons, point 37).\n\nAdmissibility of the referral\n\nRequirements for admissibility\n\n43. According to Article 112(1)(a) EPC, \"[i]n order to ensure uniform application of the law, or if a point of law of fundamental importance arises\", a board of appeal \"shall, during proceedings on a case and either of its own motion or following a request from a party to the appeal, refer any question to the Enlarged Board of Appeal if it considers that a decision is required for the above purposes.\"\n\n44. The Enlarged Board must examine the above admissibility requirements with respect to each referred question individually (G 1/19, OJ EPO 2021, A77, Reasons, point 56, with further references).\n\nQuestion I - Jurisdiction of the EPO\n\n45. Since the Enlarged Board takes the position that question II should be admitted (see below points 49 ff), question I should also be admitted for the sole reason that the questions are interlinked insofar as an affirmative answer to question I is a precondition for approaching question II. However, question I in itself already fulfils the requirement of Article 112(1) EPC that an answer is required to ensure uniform application of the law or because a point of law of fundamental importance arises.\n\n46. The issue of entitlement to priority arises with every patent application for which priority from an earlier application is claimed or which is confronted with prior art patent documents claiming priority. Where priority entitlement is disputed in any proceedings, the EPO instance addressing the issue must (at least implicitly) decide on question I. The question - or an affirmative answer thereto - thus can be viewed as fundamental for any investigation of priority entitlement under Article 87(1) EPC. The discussion concerning question I in the present referral proceedings shows that fundamental questions of law are touched upon, such as the extent of the EPO's jurisdiction for questions of civil law or the right of a third party to challenge entitlement to priority rights to which the third party cannot claim any entitlement.\n\n47. It has been argued in certain amicus curiae briefs (Vossius & Partner and Grund IP Group) that question I should not be admitted because there was no conflicting case law on the issue of the EPO's jurisdiction. However, diverging decisions are not a requirement for the admissibility of a referral if a board is referring a question to the Enlarged Board (Article 112(1)(a) EPC). Regardless of whether or not any decisions are in direct conflict with e.g. T 844/18, the EPO's jurisdiction concerning the entitlement to the priority right has been questioned by boards of appeal in several cases (see the referring decision, Reasons, point 26), and the issue is arising in various other cases before different boards. The condition that an answer of the EPO is required to ensure uniform application of the law is therefore met.\n\n48. The Enlarged Board is satisfied that both of the alternative conditions of Article 112(1)(a) EPC are met (point of law of fundamental importance and necessity to ensure uniform application of the law). The condition that an answer to question 1 is needed for the referring board to decide is met because an answer is needed to question II (above point 45). For these reasons, referred question I is admissible.\n\nQuestion II - Validity of the priority in the specific case\n\n49. Question II mirrors the facts underlying the referring decision (see above point 38). An answer to question II is therefore required for the referring board to decide in the two pending appeal cases.\n\n50. As described above (point 37), question II concerns a specific situation related to US law where only inventor(s) could file a patent application. This requirement has ceased to exist. However, apart from the two cases underlying this referral, there are still a significant number of cases pending where the application was filed while only inventors could apply for a US patent (see e.g. case T 419/16, where an interlocutory decision was taken on 3 February 2022 to stay the appeal proceedings until a decision is issued in the present referral). Moreover, inventors still act as applicants for the US only in cases where the PCT application is filed both for the US and for protection in Europe under the EPC.\n\n51. While the question refers to a specific situation, the answer would not necessarily be limited to the viability of the \"PCT joint applicants approach\" and it may cover other situations where the applicant's entitlement to the priority right is challenged. However, even if the answer covered only the situations described in question II, the question is considered to touch a point of law of fundamental importance in the terms of Article 112(1) EPC.\n\n52. The Enlarged Board is not aware of any case law challenging the viability of the \"PCT joint applicants approach\". However, it is noted that the possible legal bases for this concept have been questioned even in the referring decision (Reasons, points 28 to 33). The fact that there are different legal bases proposed for the \"PCT joint applicants\" approach already shows that there is no uniform approach to this concept. Moreover, decisions of national courts (see Reasons of the referring decision, points 40 and 41) and various amicus curiae briefs base their positions supporting an applicant's right to priority on other arguments than the \"PCT joint applicants approach\" (see above point 24). In view of future case law, it is desirable that not only the answer to question II is uniform but also the basic reasoning behind such answer.\n\n53. Since an answer to question II is necessary for the referring board to decide the pending appeal cases and at least the criterion of \"a point of law of fundamental importance\" under Article 112(1)(a) is met, question II is admissible.\n\nThe \"right of priority\" and its assignment under Article 87 EPC\n\nPurpose of priority rights\n\n54. The basic purpose of the right of priority is to safeguard, for a limited period, the interests of patent applicants in their endeavour to obtain international protection for their inventions, thereby alleviating the negative consequences of the principle of territoriality in patent law (T 15/01, OJ EPO 2006, 153, Reasons, point 32, with references to the relevant literature). The priority provisions contained in the Paris Convention should not be regarded as a body of exception clauses which should be interpreted strictly (see in this respect T 998/99, OJ EPO 2005, 229, Reasons, point 3.1; see also T 1201/14, Reasons, point 3.2.1.3). To the contrary, the Rules of the Paris Convention and the self-contained priority system of the EPC should be construed in a manner which ensures that the above-mentioned general purpose is fulfilled as far as possible (T 15/01, Reasons, point 34, confirmed in T 5/05, Reasons, point 4.4; see also Straus, The Right to Priority in Article 4A(1) of the Paris Convention and Article 87(1) of the European Patent Convention, JIPLP 2019, 687, 688/689).\n\n55. For the person filing a patent application in a state addressed in Article 87(1) EPC, the priority system means that it has the option to file a bundle of subsequent applications for the same invention in a freely selected group of other territories where each of the later (national or regional) applications may benefit from the priority date of the first application. The priority period of twelve months on the one hand allows for an evaluation by the applicant as to where patent protection should be sought. On the other hand, the clear limitation of the period provides legal certainty to third parties who ought to know the geographical limitations of the patent protection they may be confronted with.\n\n56. The effect of the priority right (namely, the exclusion of intermediate prior art; see above point 26) often concerns publications originating from the priority applicant or persons connected with it. The priority right thus also protects an applicant from its own intermediate prior art and allows it to publish the content of the priority application before the subsequent applications are filed. This aspect is of particular relevance in a patent system like the European patent system that generally does not provide grace periods prior to filing a patent application during which publications of the applicant are non-prejudicial.\n\n57. Only the subsequent application (for which priority is claimed) and the respective applicant may benefit from the priority right. For the priority application, the priority right derived therefrom is irrelevant since for the priority application there is no period between the priority date and the application date (and, consequently, no intermediate prior art).\n\nEPO case law under Article 87 EPC\n\nJurisdiction of the EPO\n\n58. In most of the cases where the boards had to assess whether the applicant of a subsequent application was entitled to claim priority under Article 87(1) EPC, the boards tacitly assumed that they had jurisdiction for such assessment. In T 844/18, where this jurisdiction was challenged, the board affirmed its jurisdiction, primarily because it saw no reason why it should concern itself with three of the requirements for priority under Article 87(1) EPC (where? / what? / when?) but not with the first requirement (who?) (see Reasons, points 11 to 14). The board also did not see a possibility for applying Article 60(3) EPC (i.e. the presumption that the applicant is entitled to exercise the right to a European patent) by analogy to the right to claim priority under Article 87(1) EPC (Reasons, point 15). These views in T 844/18 were confirmed in T 2431/17, see Reasons, point 1.5.2).\n\n59. However, deviating positions have been discussed within the boards of appeal, as shown in the non-binding preliminary view of the board in the communication of 14 June 2017 in case T 239/16. (The priority issue was not relevant for the final decision.) There is more widespread scepticism concerning the EPO's jurisdiction for determining entitlement to priority. This has also been demonstrated by the positions taken in the amicus curiae briefs and by the different positions taken by the two opponents in the inter partes case underlying this referral (see above point 22).\n\n60. From the case law quoted by the different stakeholders, the conclusion could be drawn that before T 62/05 and T 788/05, the entitlement to priority was not regularly questioned, which would mean that the EPO's jurisdiction in this respect was not an issue in most cases. Earlier decisions quoted in this context (most notably T 1008/96) appear to be isolated cases. Another early decision, J 11/95 is even quoted as a counterexample since it held that the EPO had no jurisdiction to decide claims to the right to national patent applications or priority rights derived therefrom (Reasons, point 4). In an amicus curiae brief (efpia) it was noted that attacks on formal priority started to become routine in EPO oppositions from about 2010, and it was speculated that such objections became popular after practitioners became alerted through some decisions of national courts in the United Kingdom and because they offered a simple way to invalidate patents whenever there was intervening prior art. In response to a question in the Enlarged Board's communication of 21 March 2023, respondent I provided, in its letter of 5 May 2023, statistical evidence supporting the assertion that there has been a \"dramatic increase in frequency\" of priority entitlement challenges from 2015 onwards.\n\n61. Considering the rarity of priority entitlement challenges during the first decades of the EPO, it can be concluded that the boards' case law is substantially uniform (at least during the past 10 or 15 years) insofar as the EPO is viewed to have jurisdiction to decide who is entitled to claim priority. When it comes to how the EPO should decide disputes on entitlement to priority, the case law is diverging or has not developed much in many aspects.\n\nApplication of national law to assess succession under Article 87(1)EPC\n\n62. According to consistent case law, national law is applicable to the succession in title addressed in Article 87(1) EPC (see e.g. T 1201/14, Reasons, point 3.1.2, with further references). The EPC contains no conflict of laws rules for the determination of the applicable national laws except for the provision in Article 60(1) EPC that for employee inventions the right to a European patent shall be determined in accordance with the law of the State in which the employee is mainly employed or in accordance with the law of the State in which the employer has the place of business to which the employee is attached. This rule is addressed to the national courts of the Contracting States assessing disputes concerning the right to a European patent as addressed in Article 61(1) EPC. The EPC does not contain, in particular, any conflict of laws rules applicable to the transfer of rights from an applicant other than the inventor(s) to the successor(s) of such applicant (see e.g. T 205/14, Reasons, point 3.6.5; T 725/14, Reasons, point 4.3; T 1201/14, Reasons, point 3.1.2).\n\n63. Conflict of laws rules concerning the succession under Article 87(1) EPC could refer to a range of different national laws. In T 1201/14 the following possibilities were listed (Reasons, point 3.1.2):\n\na) the law of the country where the first application was filed (\"lex originis\");\n\nb) the law of the country where the subsequent application was filed (\"lex loci protectionis\");\n\nc) the law of the country which is agreed upon in the relevant contract (\"lex loci contractus\");\n\nd) the law of the country where at least one of the parties to the transfer has its residence (\"lex domicilii\").\n\n64. Any one of these options is related to specific issues which may imply further uncertainties. For example, the freedom to choose the applicable law of a contract (e.g. an employment contract) may be limited and choice of law rules tied to the territory of the priority application or of the subsequent application (options a) and b) listed above) are difficult to apply where a patent territory does not coincide with the territory in which the relevant law applies (in the territory of US patents federal law and state laws apply, the territory of a European patent encompasses a multitude of jurisdictions with different laws). In sum, the private international law aspects of Article 87(1) EPC can be described as complex (see Moufang, in Schulte (ed.), Patentgesetz mit EPÜ, 11th ed., Hürth 2022, § 41 N 28).\n\n65. So far, no clear preference has been expressed for any choice of law rule in the EPO case law (see Maibaum, Die rechtsgeschäftliche Übertragung des Prioritätsrechts bei europäischen Patenten, Hürth 2021, p. 24-30). In several cases before the boards of appeal, the succession under Article 87(1) EPC was assessed under different national laws for the same set of facts with the same result, and, as a consequence, the board did not have to decide which law was applicable. For example, in T 577/11, the board found that none of the appellant's lines of argument, which were based on the applicability of Italian and Dutch law, led to a finding favourable for the applicant (Reasons, point 6.3). In T 1201/14 (see Reasons, point 3.2), the appellant relied on four lines of arguments to support its entitlement to priority: a (retroactive) nunc pro tunc assignment under US law, an implicit transfer by virtue of a general policy under German law, a \"direct transfer\" under US law and an implicit transfer by virtue of a general policy under Taiwanese law. Since none of these lines of arguments was both admitted and accepted by the board, there was no reason to determine the applicable national law (Reasons, point 3.3).\n\n66. In cases where the applicable national law is determined, national provisions are regularly applied by the boards of appeal. For example, the board in T 205/14, found that Israeli law was applicable and, relying on opinions of experts in that law, that Israeli law on service inventions did not provide for formal requirements to be fulfilled in the context of the transfer of the rights related to service inventions (Reasons, point 3.7). Parties are regularly requested to file evidence (such as a legal opinion from an independent law expert) concerning the effects of the applicable national laws (see already J 19/87, Facts and Submissions, point VIII).\n\n67. For the referring board, it was \"far from clear\" that the legal requirement for the transfer of priority rights by agreement should be assessed under national law, as the EPC does not contain any conflict of laws rules (referring decision, Reasons, point 37). The referring board drew the conclusion from earlier case law that the EPC did not seem to impose any formal requirements for the transfer of priority rights by agreement. Consequently, it envisaged - at least for the situation addressed in question II - that an implicit agreement could be sufficient to bring about the transfer of the priority right for the EPC territory (Reasons, point 38).\n\nAutonomous considerations discussed while assessing succession under Article 87(1) EPC\n\n68. It has been deduced from the wording of Article 87(1) EPC (without reference to national law) that the transfer of the right of priority has to have been concluded before the filing of the subsequent European patent application (T 1201/14, Reasons, point 3.1.1.1; T 577/11, Reasons, point 6.5, Catchword 3; T 1946/21, Reasons, point 2.3). The requirement that the right of priority has to be transferred before the filing of the subsequent application can be described as a requirement based on autonomous substantive law under the EPC.\n\n69. Another autonomous rule has been discussed in view of Article 72 EPC, although with different outcomes. In T 62/05, the board required an equally high standard of proof for the transfer of priority rights as the one required for the assignment of a European patent application, i.e. that the assignment of priority rights had to be in writing and had to be signed by or on behalf of the parties to the transaction (Reasons, point 3.9). In T 205/14, on the other hand, the application of Article 72 EPC to the transfer of a right of priority was rejected (Reasons, point 3.6; see also T 517/14, Reasons, point 2.7.1).\n\nNational case law under Article 87 EPC\n\n70. If questions of entitlement to claim priority under Article 87(1) EPC arise in national proceedings, the court seised needs to address all issues concerning the applicant's identity or succession, including the determination and application of foreign laws. However, in proceedings before national courts, conflict of laws issues and the related application of foreign law tend to cause less concern than in proceedings before the EPO. On the one hand, national courts can rely on their applicable conflict of laws rules and the respective case law. On the other hand, the domestic (substantive) laws of the national court are often applicable, either because the applicable conflict of laws rules refer to it or because conflict of laws issues are not relevant in cases not having connections to more than one jurisdiction.\n\n71. If the facts of a case involve one or more jurisdictions other than the court's own jurisdiction, the court's set of conflict of laws rules is applied by first qualifying the legal relationship at issue in view of the individual conflict of laws rule that may be applicable. Specific statutory conflict of laws rules for the transfer of priority rights do generally not exist in national legislations on private international law. German courts have found, for example, that the validity of the transfer of a right to claim priority is subject to the laws of the state of the priority application (lex originis) while the obligations between the assignor and the assignee are subject to the laws applicable to the contractual relationship between these parties (lex contractus) (see the summary in German Federal Court of Justice X ZR 14/17 - Drahtloses Kommunikationsnetz, point 68).\n\n72. The referring decision (in Reasons, point 40) cited another decision of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof, BGH) where the German conflict of laws rules, including the Rome I Regulation (see below point 80) pointed to the applicability of German law, which did not require any particular formalities for the transfer of priority rights. In view of the relationship between the parties to the transfer and a research and development agreement concluded between them, the German Federal Court of Justice accepted that there was an implicit agreement (\"konkludente Einigung\") between the parties, which was sufficient to acknowledge priority for the European patent (BGH, X ZR 49/12 - Fahrzeugscheibe, points 12 to 18).\n\n73. In a decision of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales (Accord v RCT [2017] EWHC 2711 (Ch)), entitlement to priority was critical because it could not be shown that the applicant's entitlement to priority had been secured by the date of the subsequent application (point 66). Reference was made to earlier case law which \"accepted a significant softening to what otherwise might have been the rigour of the rule that the title must be secured by the time the international application is made, by accepting an analysis based on common law principles distinguishing the equitable and legal title to property\". If such distinction could be made, it was sufficient for the applicant to hold \"the equitable or beneficial title to the priority right\" at the date of the application (point 67).\n\nTransfer of different rights to the subsequent applicant claiming priority\n\n74. The figure below shows in a simplified manner how an inventor (or their employer or other legal successor) may obtain international patent protection, using the priority system established under the Paris Convention.\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\n75. The inventor may apply for a patent in every territory or may transfer the right to obtain a patent to separate applicants for the different territories. Inventors often assign the right to the patents in all territories to a single applicant who then files a priority application. Within the priority period, the priority applicant or other applicants may file patent applications in other territories which benefit from the application date of the priority application (i.e. the priority date).\n\n76. The dashed and the dotted lines represent the right to file a patent (evolving into the title to the patent application after filing in the respective territory). Applicant B may obtain the right to file a patent for territory 2 from the priority applicant who acquired the rights for all territories from the inventor. Applicant B may also acquire the right to file a patent for territory 2 directly from the inventor. Within international groups of companies, the inventor's employer company may acquire the rights for all territories and then vest its subsidiaries in the different territories with the patent rights for the respective territories. These possibilities reflect the fact that the title to a patent application is a property right that is established and may be transferred for each territory in accordance with the laws of the respective territory.\n\n77. The priority right (straight lines) may be obtained only as a consequence of the filing of the priority application (see below points 83 ff). The priority applicant needs to provide any subsequent applicant with the documents required in the respective territory for claiming priority. The priority right remains relevant for the subsequent application and any patent based thereon but it is not relevant for the priority application.\n\n78. If the priority applicant (Applicant A) transfers the title to the subsequent application to the subsequent applicant (Applicant B), this transfer is normally realised together with the transfer of the priority right (encircled arrows). In the agreements discussed in priority entitlement cases, no distinction is usually made between the two transfers (see below points 93 ff). Also in the existing EPO case law under Article 87(1) EPC (see above points 58 ff), it is not always clear whether the transfer at issue encompasses only the priority right or also the title to the subsequent European application. However, the fact that different parties are potentially involved in the transfer of the different rights already shows that a clear distinction should be made between the title to the subsequent application and the priority right, i.e. the right to attribute the date of the priority application to this application. As will be shown in the following paragraphs, only the transfer of the priority right (straight line) is relevant for the proceedings before the EPO for the purposes of Article 87(1) EPC.\n\nCompetence and applicable law for the transfer of the different rights invoked by the subsequent applicant\n\nTitle to the subsequent application\n\n79. In proceedings before the EPO, the applicant shall be deemed to be entitled to exercise the right to the European patent (Article 60(3) EPC). The EPO has no power to decide a dispute as to whether a particular applicant is legally entitled to apply for and be granted a European patent in respect of the subject-matter of a particular application. The determination of questions of entitlement to the right to the grant of a European patent prior to grant is governed by the \"Protocol on Jurisdiction and the Recognition of Decisions in respect of the Right to the grant of a European patent\" (the \"Protocol on Recognition\"), which is an integral part of the EPC (G 3/92, OJ EPO 1994, 607, Reasons, point 3). The Protocol on Recognition governs the jurisdiction of the national courts of the Contracting States for disputes on entitlement to European patent applications. After grant, the national courts are competent to decide on disputes on the title to the European patent for each of the designated Contracting States. During disputes on the right to the grant of a European patent, the proceedings for grant before the EPO are regularly stayed in accordance with the provisions of Rule 14 EPC.\n\n80. Disputes on the title to a European patent application or patent are resolved by the national courts by first determining the applicable law, applying their conflict of laws rules. These rules form part of the respective legislation on private international law but there are attempts to harmonise conflict of laws rules. For example, EU Regulation 593/2008 of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I Regulation) provides uniform conflict of laws rules for contractual obligations in civil and commercial matters.\n\n81. Article 60(3) EPC applies to the applicant of any European patent application, regardless of whether it is a priority or first application or a subsequent application. In the case depicted in the figure above (point 74), assuming that the subsequent application is a European patent application, the national courts would be competent to decide on the title to this European patent application in accordance with the Protocol on Recognition.\n\n82. As far as the title to the priority application is concerned, Article 60(3) EPC is not directly applicable, unless the priority application is a European application. If the title to the subsequent European patent application has been acquired from the priority applicant, national courts may have to assess under the applicable national laws who was entitled to the priority application in order to establish the chain of transfers leading to the subsequent applicant.\n\nRight to claim the priority date for the subsequent application\n\n83. According to decision T 205/14 (Reasons, point 3.3), the right to priority, that is, the right to claim priority for a European patent application from the filing date of an eligible \"first application\" or \"previous application\" originates in the applicant of the first application. The prevailing literature also assumes that the first application, not only a subsequent application, establishes the priority right under the Paris Convention (see Wieczorek, Die Unionspriorität im Patentrecht, Köln etc. 1975, p. 21, with further references). The filing of a first application may be seen as the creation of a bundle of potential priority rights that come into existence and may be examined only when they are invoked in a subsequent application.\n\n84. For the subsequent application, priority rights are governed exclusively by Articles 87 to 89 EPC (see above point 25). It may be discussed whether the priority right with the priority applicant is established under Article 87(1) EPC or under the Paris Convention. In any case, no national laws are involved when a priority right is created or claimed for a subsequent application. This is a significant difference to the title to a European patent application or patent, which depends upon national laws (for example, employment law or property law).\n\n85. Since the creation, the existence and the effects of the priority right are governed only by the EPC (and by the Paris Convention through its relationship with the EPC), priority rights are autonomous rights under the EPC and should be assessed only in the context of the EPC, regardless of any national laws.\n\n86. Consequently, the entitlement to claim priority (and any related assignments of priority rights) should also be assessed under the autonomous law of the EPC. There are decisions that have approached the transfer of priority rights under autonomous rules (see above point 68 for the requirement that the priority right is assigned before the filing of the subsequent application and point 69 for the requirement of a written agreement). The Enlarged Board endorses the assessment of priority entitlement under the autonomous law of the EPC but not necessarily all rules discussed in this context in the existing case law. The autonomous requirements for the valid transfer of priority rights should not be stricter than national rules applicable to the transfer of priority rights or other property rights. As the referring board noted, the EPC does not impose any formal requirements for the transfer of the priority right by agreement (referring decision, Reasons, point 38).\n\n87. A decision of the Court of Appeal of the Hague in the case Biogen/Genentech v Celltrion of 30 July 2019 quoted in the referring decision (Reasons, point 36) applied the EPC as the lex loci protectionis for the assessment of the validity of a priority claim. From the perspective of the EPC, the legislation of the EPC and related international treaties, such as the Paris Convention and the PCT, is autonomous.\n\n88. It has often been discussed whether Article 60(3) EPC could be applied by analogy to the \"right of priority\" addressed in Article 87(1) EPC. Such application by analogy would result in a legal fiction (for the purposes of the proceedings before the EPO) that the subsequent applicant is deemed to be entitled to exercise the \"right of priority\" if the formal requirements are fulfilled. The main argument supporting such application by analogy was that the difficulties related to an assessment of the title to the application by the EPO (applicability of national laws, lack of conflict of laws rules etc.) would apply equally to the assessment of entitlement to priority. This argument in favour of an application of Article 60(3) EPC by analogy is of course not pertinent if entitlement to priority is assessed exclusively under the autonomous law of the EPC.\n\n89. It is undisputed that Article 60(3) EPC is not directly applicable to disputes about the transfer of the \"right of priority\". In a codified system that has adopted the principles set forth in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a judge can establish rules going beyond the literal meaning of a legal provision (whether by analogy or otherwise) only if there is a lacuna in the law, in particular where situations arise for which the legislator has omitted to provide (see G 1/97, OJ EPO 2000, 322, Reasons, point 3(b)). If the legislator did not want to include a provision for certain situations, there is no lacuna to fill (see G 2/04, OJ EPO 2005, 549, Reasons, point 2.1.2; see also Schachenmann, Die Methoden der Rechtsfindung der Grobetaen Beschwerdekammer, GRUR Int. 2008, 702, section IV). As has been shown by many contributors to the discussions in the present referral, the drafters of the EPC did consider that disputes about the entitlement to priority could arise (e.g. by discussing whether subsequent applicants should be obliged to file specific evidence of their right to claim priority). The Enlarged Board thus concludes that the drafters intentionally left open the question of the EPO's competence to decide on the priority entitlement. Consequently, there is no lacuna in this respect that could be filled by an application by analogy of Article 60(3) EPC.\n\n90. Another argument invoked by many stakeholders against the EPO's competence to assess entitlement to priority is the separation of powers between national courts and the EPO enshrined in Article 60(3) EPC, which avoids the need for the EPO to apply national laws (see e.g. Bremi, A New Approach to Priority Entitlement: Time for Another Resolving EPO Decision, GRUR Int. 2018, 128, 130). Such separation of powers can be respected even when the EPO is competent to assess priority entitlement if a clear distinction is made between, on the one hand, the priority right and its transfer as a matter governed by the autonomous law of the EPC and assessed by the EPO, and, on the other hand, the title to the subsequent application and its transfer, which is governed by national laws and assessed by national courts.\n\n91. Furthermore, acknowledging the EPO's competence to assess priority entitlement respects the argument that the EPO, in view of Article 87(1) EPC, has to assess all aspects of the right of priority and that no distinction should be made between the \"where\", \"what\" and \"when\" requirements on the one hand and the \"who\" requirement on the other hand (T 844/18, Reasons, points 12 to 20). If all four requirements relevant under Article 87(1) EPC are assessed by the EPO, the EPO is competent for all aspects that may be relevant to determine the prior art, enabling it to assess all aspects of patentability. In contrast, national courts would remain competent to assess entitlement to the patent application or patent without getting involved in any questions related to patentability.\n\n92. Even if the \"who\" requirement underlying Article 87(1) EPC is related to entitlement issues, it is clearly a criterion relevant for the validity of the patent based on the subsequent application since it is relevant for the delimitation of the prior art. Entitlement may be relevant in other contexts of prior art determination, e.g. where it is disputed whether certain information or use of items was made available to the public in the terms of Article 54(2) EPC. If the EPO can assess all aspects of the determination of prior art, the EPO's finding on patentability is based on a comprehensive assessment. If the EPO was barred from assessing priority entitlement, situations could arise in which the EPO has evidence potentially affecting the patentability of an invention but cannot use such evidence in its decision on patentability. Disputes on the entitlement to the patent, on the other hand, do not affect the EPO's findings on the patentability of the invention and the evidence and assessments underlying such findings, such as the EPO's determination of the relevant prior art.\n\nNational and autonomous considerations on the succession under Article 87(1) EPC\n\nPriority entitlement and contractual succession assessed under national laws / by national courts\n\n93. Agreements under which the subsequent applicant acquires the title to the subsequent application and the right of priority usually fail to distinguish between the two rights. For example, most employment agreements under which inventors who filed the priority application assign their rights to a subsequent applicant describe the object of the assignment in a very generic way (e.g. \"any and all rights related to the invention in any jurisdiction\". The agreement quoted in T 1201/14 (Reasons, point 3.2.1.1) refers to \"the entire right, title and interest throughout the world in and to the invention\" and adds \"including ... the right to claim priority based on the filing date of the [priority application]\". Such clause could be read as distinguishing between the title to the subsequent European application (\"title ... throughout the world\") and the right to claim priority based on the earlier US application. However, such specific references to the priority right are rare, particularly in employment agreements which are often the basis for the transfer of the right to the patents and of the respective priority rights.\n\n94. In a decision of 2018, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof, BGH, case X ZR 14/17 - Drahtloses Kommunikationsnetz) analysed the differing views on the nature of the priority right in different Contracting States of the EPO: German literature and jurisprudence, on the one hand, consider the priority right to be an independent property right that may be assigned from the applicant of the priority application to a third party as its successor in title. In the English jurisprudence, on the other hand, the person having the rights to the invention is considered to be the \"successor in title\" for the purposes of the priority right (point 62). The German Federal Court of Justice concluded, however, that both views led to the same result in cases where, after the filing of the priority application, the title to the invention is transferred from the applicant of the priority application to the applicant of the subsequent application since the transfer agreement for the subsequent application regularly has to be interpreted in a way that it tacitly encompasses the right to claim priority for the subsequent application (point 63).\n\n95. In the treaty of Bodenhausen on the Paris Convention (above point 30, see p. 37) and in an amicus curiae brief (IP Federation), reference was made to a French decision of 1962 (TGI Valence of 16 February 1962, Ann. 1963, 313-328). This decision found that the priority right is not an independent right which can be assigned on its own but a right that can only be assigned simultaneously with the right for the assignee to file a patent application in another country. In one of the English decisions referred to in \"Drahtloses Kommunikationsnetz\", the court held that the \"successor in title\" in Article 4A(1) Paris Convention must mean successor in title to the invention (High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Edwards v Cook [2009] EWHC 1304 (Pat), point 93). The High Court of Justice of England and Wales later held that \"[u]sually the right to claim priority goes with the right to the invention\" (High Court of Justice of England and Wales (Accord v RCT [2017] EWHC 2711 (Ch), point 75).\n\n96. Also national statutes implementing Article 4(1) Paris Convention appear to be based on the assumption that the acquisition of the title to the subsequent application automatically entitles the respective applicant to claim priority (see Article 18(2) Swiss Patent Act: \"The right of priority may be claimed by the first applicant or the person who has acquired the right belonging to the first applicant to file a patent application in Switzerland for the same invention.\"). Other Contracting States of the EPC have not adapted their national laws to the 1911 amendment of the Paris Convention (above point 30); the \"successor in title\" is still missing from e.g. § 41 of the German Patent Act and Article 9 of the Dutch Patent Act).\n\n97. Thus, it may be concluded that within Europe there are differing views on the relevance of the \"right of priority\" addressed in Article 87(1) EPC as a property right separate from the title to the subsequent application for which the priority is claimed. There is a widespread view that the priority right is a mere ancillary right to the right to the subsequent patent application or patent which automatically follows any transfer of the title to the patent application or patent or, depending on the jurisdiction, that the title to the subsequent application automatically implies priority entitlement. These views however do not consider the possibility that the title to the subsequent application has not been acquired from the priority applicant (see above the figure in point 74). They also do not sufficiently reflect the fact that the priority applicant does not just transfer a right but needs also to provide active support to the subsequent applicant wishing to benefit from this right.\n\n98. Such disregard for the priority right or its interpretation as a mere ancillary right to the right to the subsequent application may however partly explain why the priority right is rarely addressed in agreements on the transfer of the patent right. If a priority right is tacitly transferred together with the right to the corresponding patent or patent application, it may be assumed that the same conditions and formal requirements apply to the transfer of both rights. If a transfer of a priority right is not considered necessary in view of the priority entitlement, there cannot be any formal requirements for such transfer. In any case, the Enlarged Board is not aware of national statutes or case law setting higher formal requirements for the transfer of the priority right than for the transfer of the right to the patent application.\n\nConsequences for the autonomous assessment of transfers of priority rights\n\n99. In most jurisdictions, rights to obtain a patent can be transferred without any written agreement or other formalities (e.g. from an employee inventor to the employer who wishes to obtain patent protection in multiple territories). The right to priority automatically follows the title to the subsequent patent application in many jurisdictions and may thus also be transferred informally. If national laws establish low or no formal requirements for the transfer of priority rights, the autonomous law of the EPC should not establish higher formal requirements than those established under national laws that may be relevant in the context of a European application. To the contrary, the EPO should adapt itself to the lowest standards established under national laws and accept informal or tacit transfers of priority rights under almost any circumstances.\n\n100. For example, the autonomous law of the EPC should not require that the assignment of priority rights has to be in writing and/or has to be signed by or on behalf of the parties to the transaction (see above point 69 for the diverging case law on this issue) since this would establish a high threshold in view of the national laws. Even the requirement that the transfer of the right of priority needs to be concluded before the filing of the subsequent European patent application (above point 68) is questionable in the Enlarged Board's view. If there are jurisdictions that allow an ex post (\"nunc pro tunc\") transfer of priority rights (see the extensive discussion of such transfers under US law in T 1201/14), the EPO should not apply higher standards. The \"rigour of the rule\" that the transfer must be completed before the filing of the subsequent application underwent a \"significant softening\" also in a 2017 decision of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales (see above point 73). However, the allowability of a retroactive transfer of priority rights may have limited practical relevance if priority entitlement is presumed to exist on the date on which priority is claimed for the subsequent European application (see below point 109).\n\nRebuttable presumption of entitlement to claim priority\n\n101. Low standards for a valid transfer of priority rights not only serve the purpose of harmonisation with national laws that could be applicable instead of the autonomous law of the EPC. They serve the purpose of priority rights, namely to facilitate international patent protection, by reducing the risk that the inventors' (or their legal successors') interest in obtaining patent protection in multiple jurisdictions is jeopardised by formal requirements they may inadvertently fail to meet.\n\n102. Any party transferring the right to a subsequent application wishes, under normal circumstances, that the subsequent applicant may benefit from the priority right. The Enlarged Board agrees with respondent I in that it is difficult to imagine a realistic scenario in which a party would transfer their rights to the invention but intentionally withhold the relevant priority right (see p. 8 of respondent I's letter of 5 May 2023). This applies also in cases where the title to the subsequent application is not transferred from the priority applicant (see the figure in point 74). The title to the priority application and the title to the subsequent application originate from the same inventor who normally desires that the priority is valid for all subsequent applications. In this context, it must be assumed that the priority applicant who has not acquired the right to the subsequent application accepts or at least tolerates the use of the priority by the subsequent applicant.\n\n103. The content of the priority application is, in general, not published or otherwise made accessible to third parties before the expiry of the twelve-month time limit for filing subsequent applications. A copy of the priority application must be filed with the EPO within sixteen months after the filing of the priority application under Rule 53(1) EPC while the publication of the priority application normally occurs eighteen months after its filing date. Moreover, the applicant of the subsequent European application must provide documentation that cannot normally be obtained without the cooperation of the priority applicant. In particular, a copy of the priority application certified as correct by the authority where the priority application was filed, must be filed with the EPO (Rule 53(1) EPC, see also Article 4D(1) Paris Convention).\n\n104. These formal requirements for claiming priority in accordance with Article 88(1) EPC can only be met by the subsequent applicant if the priority applicant provides the necessary support completely and in time. The fulfilment of these requirements can thus be seen as strong factual evidence of the priority applicant's approval of the subsequent applicant's entitlement to priority.\n\n105. The Enlarged Board comes to the conclusion that entitlement to priority should in principle be presumed to exist to the benefit of the subsequent applicant of the European patent application if the applicant claims priority in accordance with Article 88(1) EPC and the corresponding Implementing Regulations. This conclusion is reached taking into account (i) that the priority applicant or its legal predecessor must under normal circumstances be presumed to accept the subsequent applicant's reliance on the priority right, (ii) the lack of formal requirements for the transfer of priority rights and (iii) the necessary cooperation of the priority applicant with the subsequent applicant in order to allow the latter to rely on the priority right.\n\n106. The presumption also applies if the title to the subsequent application has not been acquired from the priority applicant but from a third party having the right to the invention in the respective territory (for example, from the inventor, see above the figure in point 74). Also in this situation, the priority applicant must provide the necessary support under Article 88(1) EPC, and the common predecessor with respect to the title to the two applications must be deemed to consent to the subsequent applicant's reliance on the priority right like any priority applicant assigning the title to the subsequent application.\n\n107. The considerations leading to the presumption of priority entitlement apply to any case in which the subsequent applicant is not identical with the priority applicant but receives the support of the priority applicant required under Article 88(1) EPC. It does not matter whether the subsequent European application stems from a PCT application. It is also not relevant whether and to which extent the members of a plurality of co-applicants for the priority application overlap with the group of co-applicants for the subsequent application.\n\n108. The presumption should be rebuttable since in rare exceptional cases the priority applicant may have legitimate reasons not to allow the subsequent applicant to rely on the priority. Such circumstances could, for example, be related to bad faith behaviour on the side of the subsequent applicant or to the outcome of other proceedings such as litigation before national courts about the title to the subsequent application.\n\n109. Priority entitlement is not relevant before the priority is claimed by the subsequent applicant in accordance with Rule 52 EPC, normally at the filing date of the subsequent application or otherwise within sixteen months from the filing date of the priority application. Consequently, the presumption of entitlement exists on the date on which the priority is claimed and the rebuttal of the presumption must also relate to this date. Later developments cannot affect the rebuttable presumption.\n\n110. The rebuttable presumption involves the reversal of the burden of proof, i.e. the party challenging the subsequent applicant's entitlement to priority has to prove that this entitlement is missing. If there is a strong presumption, the hurdle for rebutting it is higher than in the case of a weak presumption (see T 63/06, Reasons, point 3.2 for the rebuttal of the presumption of sufficiency of disclosure). The presumption that the subsequent applicant is entitled to the priority right is a strong presumption under normal circumstances since the other priority requirements (which establish the basis for the presumption of priority entitlement) can usually only be fulfilled with the consent and even cooperation of the priority applicant (see above points 104 ff). The party challenging the entitlement to priority can thus not just raise speculative doubts but must demonstrate that specific facts support serious doubts about the subsequent applicant's entitlement to priority.\n\n111. Like the priority entitlement in general (see above points 85 f), the presumption of its existence and the rebuttal of this presumption is subject to the autonomous law of the EPC only. Consequently, there is no room for the application of national laws on legal presumptions and their rebuttal.\n\nSpecific arguments forwarded during the referral proceedings in the context of question I\n\nLegal certainty and uniform legal situation in the designated Contracting States\n\n112. The Enlarged Board has come to the conclusion that the EPO is competent to assess priority entitlement and that a rebuttable presumption in favour of the applicant's entitlement to priority is justified in view of the purpose of the priority rights, the lack of formal requirements for the transfer of priority rights and the presumed common interest of the priority applicant and the subsequent applicant (who have to cooperate when the priority is invoked).\n\n113. In the context of priority entitlement, the requirement of legal certainty would be best served if third parties could easily, based on publicly available data, assess whether the subsequent applicant is the successor in title addressed in Article 87(1) EPC. This assessment is difficult for third parties already because the relevant documents are normally non-public and in the possession of the applicant or patent proprietor only. The rebuttable presumption of priority entitlement serves the purpose of legal certainty insofar as the applicant or patent proprietor as well as third parties can or should rely on the subsequent applicant's entitlement to priority unless specific facts support serious doubts about such entitlement.\n\n114. The requirements of legal certainty and fairness in the individual case may conflict, and it may be argued that the presumption of a priority entitlement that is unjustified in a specific case disadvantages third parties, i.e. potential opponents. In this context it should be considered that even if a \"wrong applicant\" claims priority for its subsequent application, this does not necessarily mean that the priority right cannot be relied on. In national proceedings concerning the title to the subsequent application or the priority application, the priority entitlement issue can be resolved, for example if the outcome of such national proceedings is that the priority applicant and the subsequent applicant are found to be identical. In this context, it may be noted that the EPC explicitly foresees the ex tunc assignment of priority rights, at least in the context of disputes on the right to the patent before national courts: if a person other than the original applicant is found to be entitled to the grant of the European patent, this person may choose to file a new European patent application in respect of the same invention under Article 61(1)(b) EPC. To such new applications, Article 76(1) EPC \"shall apply mutatis mutandis\" according to Article 61(2) EPC. Under Article 76(1) EPC, \"[t]he divisional application shall be deemed to have been filed on the date of filing of the earlier application and shall enjoy any right of priority\". This means that the new application filed by the rightful applicant under Article 61(1)(b) EPC is deemed to have been filed on the date of filing of the earlier application and to have the benefit of any right of priority (G 3/92, OJ EPO 1994, 607, Reasons, point 5.4). In view of legal certainty, it should thus be considered that there is always a party who is entitled to claim priority - even if this party must be determined in national proceedings. Consequently, third parties can never fully rely on the invalidity of a priority and on the potential invalidity of a patent which may result from such lack of priority entitlement.\n\n115. The EPO's competence to assess priority entitlement does of course not imply that national courts are bound by the EPO's assessments. In national proceedings concerning the validity of a European patent, relevant priority rights can be assessed taking into account all aspects, i.e. not only in view of the \"same invention\" criterion but also with respect to priority entitlement. A uniform legal situation in all designated Contracting States can therefore never be guaranteed. However, challenges to priority entitlement before national courts are subject to national restrictions (such as rules affecting the right of third parties to challenge entitlement to priority) - regardless of how the EPO assesses priority entitlement.\n\nInterest of third parties to challenge entitlement to priority\n\n116. Unlike disputes on the title to the patent application, in which normally only the applicant and other parties claiming rights to the invention are involved, challenges to the entitlement to claim priority are usually instituted by third parties, in particular by opponents. It has been argued that in a situation where the priority applicant and the subsequent applicant are in \"perfect all-time agreement\" on the transfer of the priority right, it was absurd that the priority could be declared invalid and a patent be revoked as a consequence (Bremi, A New Approach to Priority Entitlement: Time for Another Resolving EPO Decision, GRUR Int. 2018, 128, 131). The question whether there can be a public interest in allowing a third party to invalidate patents based on legal flaws related to the entitlement to priority arises both in proceedings before national courts and in proceedings before the EPO. In a decision of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales (Accord v RCT [2017] EWHC 2711 (Ch)), it was held that there was \"no obvious public interest in striking down patents on this ground, unlike all the other grounds of invalidity\" (point 77).\n\n117. It is a matter of national law whether national courts should acknowledge a legitimate interest of a third party to obtain a decision on who is entitled to claim priority under Article 87(1) EPC. In the EPC however, there are no restrictions on who can file an opposition. If the EPO is competent to assess all aspects of priority (above point 91) together with all patentability requirements ex officio in examination proceedings or on the request of an opponent, the EPO cannot refuse to assess a priority entitlement objection based on who raised the objection. The rebuttable presumption concerning priority entitlement however substantially limits the possibility of third parties, including opponents, to successfully challenge priority entitlement.\n\nEntitlement to priority in the context of PCT applications\n\nThe \"PCT joint applicants approach\"\n\n118. The PCT joint applicants approach implies that in a PCT application where parties A and B are applicants for different designated States, both applicants may rely on the priority right derived from a priority application filed by only one of the applicants, without the need for any transfer of priority rights (above point 11). Even if the \"joint applicants approach\" is acknowledged for regular European patent applications (see above point 10, T 1933/12), the use of this approach for a PCT application with different applicants for different designated territories is questionable and has been questioned in the referring decision (see Reasons, points 30 to 33).\n\n119. Under Article 118 EPC - a provision regularly quoted in support of the \"joint applicants approach\" -, different applicants for different designated Contracting States shall be regarded as joint applicants or proprietors for the purposes of the proceedings before the EPO, and the patent shall be uniform for all designated States. Exceptions from the uniformity of the European patent are foreseen in Article 118 EPC and may be justified, for example, by prior rights based on national patent applications (Article 139(2) EPC).\n\n120. The PCT does not contain a provision like Article 118 EPC, which would impose a common procedural role throughout the grant proceedings to a plurality of applicants and prescribe the uniformity of the patent for different designated territories. A PCT application, after being accorded an international filing date, has the effect of a regular national application in each designated State (Article 11(3) PCT) which is prosecuted by the respective applicant for each designated State. The examination is carried out by the patent offices of each designated territory according to its own rules. The PCT does not exclude that different priority rights exist for different designated territories, be it for material reasons (e.g. the \"same invention\" criterion may be interpreted differently and is dependent on the subject-matter claimed before the respective patent office), be it for formal reasons (e.g. the applicant for one territory may not be entitled to a priority right while another applicant for another territory is entitled to claim priority stemming from the same priority application).\n\n121. However, a general decision on the viability of the PCT joint applicants approach is not needed. The concept of an implied agreement (below points 122 ff) should allow an assessment leading to the same result as the PCT joint applicants approach in most cases.\n\nThe concept of an implied agreement\n\n122. Where no formal requirements for the transfer of priority rights exist, priority rights can be transferred under an informal or implicit agreement (see the German case referred to above in point 72, where an implicit agreement was found to be sufficient to acknowledge priority entitlement). In the situation addressed in question II, the priority applicant (party A) actively presents itself together with the other subsequent applicant (party B) as an applicant to the office where the subsequent application is filed. Together they claim priority from the priority application of party A to the benefit of both parties. Even if the subsequent PCT application may be filed by a joint representative, the priority applicant should know about the details of this application and the related proceedings, including the claiming of priority that also benefits its co-applicant.\n\n123. The Enlarged Board concurs with the referring board in that in the circumstances described in question II, the mutual filing demonstrates - absent indications to the contrary - the existence of an implicit agreement between party A and party B, conferring party B the right to benefit from the priority for the EPC territory (referring decision, Reasons, point 38).\n\n124. The joint filing of the PCT application cannot in every case establish final proof of the existence of an implied agreement. However, under normal circumstances it can be assumed that the priority applicant and co-applicant for the subsequent application (party A) agrees that the subsequent application should take the full benefit of the priority for all applicants. Party A or its predecessors (including the inventor) normally have a common interest with party B in the validity of the priority for all territories encompassed by the subsequent PCT application.\n\n125. The Enlarged Board concludes that, in the absence of clear indications to the contrary, the joint filing of the subsequent PCT application sufficiently proves that the parties entered into an implied agreement allowing party B to rely on the priority right established by the filing of the priority application by party A. Since the considerations leading to this conclusion not only apply in the context of PCT applications, the concept and the conditions for an implied agreement equally apply to co-applicants directly filing a subsequent European application if at least one of the co-applicants was an applicant for the priority application.\n\n126. To put into question the implied agreement, evidence would be needed that an agreement on the use of the priority right has not been reached or is fundamentally flawed. For example, party B could act in bad faith to the detriment of party A who may then not be fully informed about the subsequent PCT application. A dispute between the parties at the relevant filing date was mentioned in an amicus curiae brief (efpia) as a further example (point 3.2). Factual indications putting into question the implied agreement have to be of a substantial nature and have to be presented by the party questioning the implied agreement. The implied agreement is to be assessed under the autonomous law of the EPC, which does not foresee any formal requirements for the transfer of priority rights (above point 86). Assessing the existence of an implied agreement under the autonomous law of the EPC is consistent with the approach chosen for the rebuttable presumption for the priority entitlement (above point 86) and appropriate in view of the object of the implied agreement, which is governed by the EPC and the Paris Convention only.\n\n127. Transfers of private rights and underlying agreements are normally subject to national civil laws, but there are instances where the EPC regulates aspects of national civil laws in order to establish uniform standards (see e.g. Article 72 EPC on the form of the assignment of a European patent application or the development of an autonomous concept of universal succession in T 2357/12). In this context, it is justified in the Enlarged Board's view to consider the agreement implied by the joint filing of a subsequent application to be an agreement governed only by the autonomous law of the EPC.\n\n128. An agreement (regardless of its form) can only be held against parties who were involved in the facts establishing the agreement. Co-applicants for the priority application who were not involved in the subsequent application may not be deemed to have consented to the reliance on the priority right by the other co-applicants for the priority application (a situation underlying e.g. T 844/18). The subsequent applicant(s) may however still be entitled to claim priority since the rebuttable presumption of entitlement does not depend on whether the involved applicants acted as co-applicants at any stage.\n\nImplications for the referred questions\n\nQuestion 1 - Competence of the EPO to assess priority entitlement\n\n129. The subsequent applicant wishing to file a European patent application should not only hold the title to that European application (i.e. the right to the European patent) but also the priority right if such right is claimed for the European application. In the context of the EPC and the proceedings before the EPO, a strict distinction should be made between the two rights. The title to the subsequent application, on the one hand, is subject to national property laws. Its transfer is governed by national laws (to be determined in accordance with national conflict of laws rules) and assessed by national courts in view of Article 60(3) EPC (above points 79 ff). The right to claim the priority date for the subsequent European application, on the other hand, has been shown to be a right created under the autonomous law of the EPC and the Paris Convention, the transfer of which should also be assessed under the autonomous law of the EPC (above points 83 ff).\n\n130. The exclusive application of the autonomous law of the EPC to the transfer of priority rights removes the need for conflict of laws rules and the application of national laws, thereby eliminating two main reasons invoked against the EPO's competence to assess whether a party is entitled to claim priority under Article 87(1) EPC. After evaluating various arguments supporting and denying this competence of the EPO (above points 83 ff, 93 ff), the Enlarged Board concludes that the EPO is competent to assess priority entitlement.\n\n131. In view of the interests of the parties involved, the lack of formal requirements for the transfer of priority rights and the necessary cooperation between the priority applicant and the subsequent applicant in the context of the procedural requirements under Article 88(1) EPC, the Enlarged Board concludes that the entitlement to priority should be presumed to exist. This presumption should be rebuttable to take into account rare exceptional cases in which the claiming of the priority by the subsequent applicant appears to be unjustified (above points 101 ff).\n\n132. If the requirements under Article 88(1) EPC are not fulfilled, the subsequent applicant is barred from claiming priority for this reason alone. The fulfilment of these procedural requirements is not covered by the rebuttable presumption. This is reflected in the order where compliance with Article 88(1) EPC and the corresponding Implementing Regulations is set as a condition for the rebuttable presumption of priority entitlement. The referral is not addressing any aspect of how these procedural requirements are addressed by the EPO.\n\n133. Like the nature and the effects of the priority right and the entitlement to priority, the rebuttable presumption in favour of the priority entitlement is subject to the autonomous law of the EPC. It cannot be excluded, however, that in the context of the rebuttal of the presumption national laws need to be considered as well. For example, the existence of legal entities being parties in transfers of priority rights may be relevant and may need an assessment under national laws.\n\nQuestion 2 - Priority entitlement in the situation addressed in question II\n\n134. Question II addresses a specific situation in which the EPO has to assess priority entitlement (given the positive answer to question I). The question concerns a group of cases where an applicant other than the priority applicant wishes to rely on the priority right for a subsequent application jointly filed by both applicants. The considerations leading to the rebuttable presumption of priority entitlement apply regardless of whether the subsequent application is a PCT application and in any case where the priority applicant (as an individual or a group) is not identical with the subsequent applicant(s) (above points 101 ff, 107). The rebuttable presumption that the subsequent applicant is entitled to rely on the priority right derived from the priority application therefore fully applies to the situation addressed in question II.\n\n135. For the situation addressed in question II, it has been proposed to extend the acknowledged \"joint applicants approach\" to a \"PCT joint applicants approach\" which has been questioned in the referring decision and by the Enlarged Board (above points 118 ff). As an alternative reasoning for a positive answer to question II, the concept of an implied agreement has been proposed not only by the referring board but also in certain amicus curiae briefs. The Enlarged Board concurs with the referring board in that in the circumstances described in question II, the mutual filing demonstrates - absent indications to the contrary - the existence of an implicit agreement between party A and party B, conferring party B the right to benefit from the priority for the EPC territory (referring decision, Reasons, point 38).\n\n136. The Enlarged Board leaves open the validity of the \"PCT joint applicants approach\" but endorses the concept of an implied agreement. It therefore concludes that, in the absence of substantial factual indications to the contrary, the joint filing of the subsequent PCT application sufficiently proves that the parties entered into an implied or informal agreement allowing party B to rely on the priority right established by the filing of the priority application by party A.\n\n137. An agreement cannot be implied if not all of a plurality of priority applicants are applicants or co-applicants for the subsequent application (the situation underlying e.g. T 844/18, above point 128). However, the rebuttable presumption of priority entitlement can be applied also in situations where one of the priority applicants is not involved in the filing of the subsequent application. In specific contexts, a priority applicant missing from the subsequent application may have reasons to claim the title to the subsequent application (in proceedings before national courts) or may possess evidence to rebut the presumption of priority entitlement in proceedings before the EPO.\n\n138. The interpretation of a joint filing as sufficient proof for an implied agreement on the joint use of the priority right in the context of a joint PCT application may apply independently from the rebuttable presumption addressed in connection with referred question I. An implied agreement in the situation addressed in question II can however reinforce the presumption of entitlement to priority stipulated in view of referred question I.",
         "ORDER, For these reasons, it is decided that the questions of law referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal are answered as follows:, I. The European Patent Office is competent to assess whether a party is entitled to claim priority under Article 87(1) EPC., There is a rebuttable presumption under the autonomous law of the EPC that the applicant claiming priority in accordance with Article 88(1) EPC and the corresponding Implementing Regulations is entitled to claim priority., II. The rebuttable presumption also applies in situations where the European patent application derives from a PCT application and/or where the priority applicant(s) are not identical with the subsequent applicant(s)., In a situation where a PCT application is jointly filed by parties A and B, (i) designating party A for one or more designated States and party B for one or more other designated States, and (ii) claiming priority from an earlier patent application designating party A as the applicant, the joint filing implies an agreement between parties A and B allowing party B to rely on the priority, unless there are substantial factual indications to the contrary.",

By its decision in appeal case T 0318/14 dated 7 February 2019 (OJ EPO 2020, A104) and issued in writing on 20 December 2019, Board of Appeal 3.3.01 referred the following questions to the Enlarged Board of Appeal:\n\n\"1. Can a European patent application be refused under Article 97(2) EPC if it claims the same subject-matter as a European patent which was granted to the same applicant and does not form part of the state of the art pursuant to Article 54(2) and (3) EPC?\n\n2.1 If the answer to the first question is yes, what are the conditions for such a refusal, and are different conditions to be applied depending on whether the European patent application under examination was filed\n\na) on the same date as, or\n\nb) as a European divisional application (Article 76(1) EPC) in respect of, or\n\nc) claiming the priority (Article 88 EPC) in respect of a European patent application on the basis of which a European patent was granted to the same applicant?\n\n2.2 In particular, in the last of these cases, does an applicant have a legitimate interest in the grant of a patent on the (subsequent) European patent application in view of the fact that the filing date and not the priority date is the relevant date for calculating the term of the European patent under Article 63(1) EPC?\"\n\nII. The appeal before the referring Board (in the following \"the Board\") was against the decision of the Examining Division refusing European patent application No. 10718590.2 under Article 97(2) EPC in conjunction with Article 125 EPC. The Examining Division found that claim 1 of the sole claim request on file was directed to subject-matter which was identical to the subject-matter claimed in European patent No. 2 251 021, which was granted for the European patent application from which the application-in-suit claimed priority. Granting a second patent on this claim was held to be contrary to the principle of the prohibition on double patenting (in the following also referred to as just \"the prohibition\"), this being an accepted principle in most patent systems, as stated in the Guidelines. The applicability of the prohibition was furthermore confirmed by an obiter statement in the Enlarged Board of Appeal's decisions G 1/05 and G 1/06. The Examining Division held that the prohibition also extended to European applications claiming an internal priority from another European application, and that decision T 1423/07 was not applicable because the applicants were different in that case.\n\nIII. The appellant applicant argued in its appeal that the prohibition did not apply in a situation of internal priority. Decisions G 1/05 and G 1/06 related to divisional applications, and applied only in that context. Decision T 1423/07 recognised the existence of a legitimate interest, namely the longer term of protection available to an applicant as a result of claiming an internal priority. The \"ne bis in idem\" principle could not support the prohibition either. Article 125 EPC was not a proper legal basis for prohibiting double patenting, because the issue was one of substantive law. The preparatory documents of the Convention, in particular points 665. and 666. of the Minutes of the Diplomatic Conference establishing the Convention, showed that at the Diplomatic Conference there was no agreement on this issue within the meaning of Article 31(2)(a) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (in the following VCLT). Although there might have been a majority agreement on a prohibition, it was restricted to applications having the same filing date. Article 139(3) EPC could not provide a basis for the prohibition either. It demonstrated that double patenting was an issue left entirely to national legislation. A referral to the Enlarged Board was warranted. During the oral proceedings before the Board, the appellant requested as its main request the grant of a patent, and as an auxiliary request a referral to the Enlarged Board, for which purpose it agreed to the wording of the questions proposed by the Board.\n\nIV. To support its arguments, the appellant referred to several documents from the collection of the preparatory documents of the Convention (commonly referred to as the \"travaux préparatoires\"). They are treated in more detail in the Reasons of the present decision.\n\nV. The referring decision examined those provisions of the Convention which have so far been considered in the case law of the boards of appeal to be a possible legal basis for the prohibition, namely Articles 60(1), 63(1), 76(1) and 125 EPC. The Board regarded none of them as suitable for this purpose.\n\nVI. The Board's doubts as to the applicability of Article 125 EPC were based on two main lines of reasoning (Reasons, points 56. to 64.). First, the Board found that the wording and scope of Article 125 EPC in themselves, i.e. without the assistance of the travaux préparatoires, could not be construed as encompassing the principle of a prohibition on double patenting. Following the rules of interpretation stipulated by Articles 31 and 32 VCLT, Article 125 EPC as interpreted under Article 31 VCLT was neither ambiguous or obscure, nor manifestly absurd or unreasonable, and therefore was not open to an interpretation under Article 32 VCLT which would also take into account the legislative intent derivable from the travaux préparatoires. Secondly, given the lack of agreement on the issue among all the Contracting States during the Diplomatic Conference, an interpretation of Article 125 EPC on the basis of a separate common agreement of all parties or an instrument accepted by all parties within the meaning of Article 31(2)(a) or (b) VCLT, respectively, was not possible either.\n\nVII. The preparatory documents relied on by the Board in connection with this and other points in its Reasons are treated in detail in the Reasons of the present decision.\n\nVIII. The President of the EPO was invited to comment on the referral, and third parties were given the opportunity to file submissions under Articles 9 and 10 of the Rules of Procedure of the Enlarged Board of Appeal (RPEBA). Their submissions were forwarded to the appellant.\n\nIX. In his comments dated 21 September 2020, the President of the EPO submitted that the legal basis for the prohibition was Article 125 EPC. The legislative intent to prohibit double patenting under this article could be clearly derived from the preparatory materials of the Convention. The existence of this principle in the majority of the Contracting States could be inferred from their national legislation implementing Article 139(3) EPC. It was true that there had been no agreement by all parties on this issue during the Diplomatic Conference, but such an agreement was not necessary. The majority agreement could still be taken into account as the identifiable legislative intent, and thus as a supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT. Recourse to the preparatory documents under Article 32 VCLT was permissible for the purpose of confirming the above interpretation of Articles 125 and 139(3) EPC. Thus the Office's long-standing practice of applying the prohibition was correct, and was also supported by decisions G 1/05 and G 1/06 of the Enlarged Board.\n\nX. Amicus curiae submissions were filed under Article 10 RPEBA by several professional associations, companies and private persons. Two submissions were made anonymously. The majority of them supported the view that there is no proper legal basis under the Convention for a prohibition on double patenting or thus for the practice of the Office.\n\nXI. The appellant made no further submissions. Nor did it request oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board. Therefore the present decision can be issued in written proceedings without prior oral proceedings.",
         "Reasons for the decision\n\nA. Admissibility of the referral\n\nA.1 Interpretation of the referred questions\n\n1. The essence of Question 1 is as follows: is there any legal basis under the EPC for refusing an application on the ground of double patenting?\n\n2. The Board set out in detail what it understood by the term \"double patenting\" (Reasons, points 17.-23.), and the Enlarged Board reads this term in the same sense. Nevertheless, while the basic question being asked may be put simply, there are good reasons why the Board was justified in wording Question 1 in a more differentiated manner, bearing in mind that the term \"double patenting\" itself may not be completely clear once isolated from the specific situations addressed in the referral and in the relatively small body of existing board of appeal case law. First, a distinction must be made between the situation falling under Article 139(3) EPC (simultaneous protection by a national and a European patent) and double patenting in the narrow sense, where two or more European applications are involved (Reasons, points 19. and 21.). Secondly, the distinction between double protection (claims with overlapping scope) and double patenting also needs to be kept in mind (Reasons, point 24.). The Enlarged Board notes that the term double protection in German (\"Doppelschutz\") is also used to denote the situation governed by Article 139(3) EPC and comparable situations of parallel protection.\n\n3. Even if \"double patenting\" is immediately understood in its narrow sense, the term alone may not be sufficient to indicate to the reader that the issue at stake in the referral is whether there is a legal basis in the EPC for prohibiting double patenting. While there is case law which deals specifically with the question of a legal basis for the prohibition, there are also decisions which concern rather the definition of \"the same subject-matter\" or \"the same applicant\" in the context of double patenting. The manner in which these elements are incorporated into the wording of Question 1 makes it clear that these points of law are not the subject of the present referral.\n\n4. The referral gives no particular explanation why Article 97(2) EPC is mentioned in Question 1. The Enlarged Board takes it that its inclusion serves to distinguish a refusal of a patent application following examination by the Examining Division from other possible refusals, such as by the Receiving Section under Article 90(5) EPC. The main focus of the referral is on an analysis of the various provisions of the Convention which have been put forward in the case law as the legal source of the double patenting prohibition (Articles 60, 63, 76, 125 EPC), and which as such may potentially be invoked in conjunction with Article 97(2) EPC as the legal basis for a refusal. The Board also stated that the referral does not extend to the question whether and how the prohibition might be applicable in opposition proceedings (Reasons, point 31.). Thus the Enlarged Board considers that the reference to Article 97(2) EPC makes it clear that the referred question is restricted to (the applicability of the prohibition during) substantive examination proceedings under Article 94 EPC before the Examining Division.\n\n5. Question 1 does not mention the additional condition that both the granted and the potential European patent must have an effect in the same territory. Given the system of designations (Articles 66 and 79 EPC), and in particular the possibility to withdraw individual designations (Article 79(3) EPC), it is the Enlarged Board's understanding that in current Office practice an objection of double patenting is only raised if there are overlapping and still valid designations in both the granted patent and the application concerned. As it is clear from the Reasons of the referring decision that the Board was well aware of this condition (points 29. and 30.), the Enlarged Board considers that it is also implied in the question itself.\n\n6. The essence of Question 2.1 is as follows: if there is a legal basis in the EPC for the prohibition on double patenting, are all three of the possible constellations in which double patenting may arise to be treated in the same manner? Common to these constellations is that the granted patent and the application both have the same effective date (point 18. of the Reasons).\n\n7. Question 2.1 is to be answered only if the Enlarged Board finds that there is a legal basis in the EPC for the double patenting prohibition. The formulation \"... what are the conditions for such a refusal ... ?\" may appear very broad in scope and intended to cover all possible criteria for establishing the conditions to be met for the double patenting prohibition to apply. For example, the referral invites the Enlarged Board to clarify the conditions for a \"[lack of a] legitimate interest\", which G 1/05 and G 1/06 saw as a possible basis for the prohibition (Reasons, point 13.4). It also invites the Enlarged Board to clarify the concept of \"the same invention\" (Reasons, point 80.). The amicus curiae submissions also ask for the criteria to be applied in defining \"the same applicant\". It is nevertheless clear from the Reasons of the referring decision that the central point of question 2.1 is really an extension of question 1, namely whether the legal basis for the prohibition in the EPC, if there is one, is applicable to all three of the constellations listed, or to only one or two of them. The Enlarged Board will limit itself to answering question 2.1 in this sense.\n\n8. As to question 2.2, it is clear that the Board is primarily interested in knowing if the reason given in T 1423/07  a legitimate interest in a longer term of protection, having regard to the obiter statement of the Enlarged Board in G 1/05 and G 1/06, Reasons, point 13.4 - may establish an exception to the double patenting prohibition for applications having different filing dates, but the same priority date.\n\n9. Questions 2.1 c) and 2.2 are also apparently restricted to cases of internal priority, in which both applications are European applications, with one of them serving as the priority application for the other. However, as pointed out in the President's comments (point 104.), the same question may be asked in cases where two European applications with different filing dates claim priority from the same national application.\n\n10. Furthermore, Questions 2.1 b) and c) already appear to be restricted to the (likelier) case in which the application filed earlier, (i.e. the application establishing the priority right, or the earlier application under Article 76 EPC - commonly referred to as the \"parent application\") is also granted first, and the examination of the subsequent application (i.e. the application claiming priority or the divisional application) is concluded later. However, any such restriction would appear to be unintended, and the question can be applied more generally to any procedurally related pairs of applications falling under the constellations of Question 2.1 b) and c), irrespective of which comes to grant first.\n\nA.2 Admissibility criteria under Article 112 EPC\n\n11. Article 112(1) EPC provides:\n\n\"In order to ensure uniform application of the law, or if a point of law of fundamental importance arises:\n\n(a) the Board of Appeal shall ... refer any question to the Enlarged Board of Appeal if it considers that a decision is required for the above purposes. ...\n\n(b) ...\"\n\n12. On this basis, a referral to the Enlarged Board by a board of appeal is admissible if there is conflicting case law in the application of the EPC, or if a point of law of fundamental importance arises. Notably, a point of law can be one of fundamental importance even without any conflicting case law. The necessity to ensure the uniform application of the law may also arise without a high number of conflicting cases (G 1/11, Reasons, point 1.). Finally, a ruling by the Enlarged Board on the question must be decisive for the case before the board (G 1/14, Reasons, point 2.).\n\n13. Question 1 of the referral concerns not merely the correct application of a legal provision, but whether certain procedures carried out by the Office have a proper legal basis. That the actions of public authorities cannot be arbitrary but must be based on the law is considered a fundamental principle of public law (principle of legality). Therefore the Enlarged Board also considers the referred question to be a point of law of fundamental importance, even without divergent or extensive case law on the issue. However, as the Board correctly identified, there is even divergent case law on the question whether any proper legal basis for a prohibition on double patenting exists at all (Reasons, points 43. to 46.), and the main part of the referring decision is dedicated to reviewing and analysing decisions in which different provisions of the EPC were identified as the possible legal basis for the prohibition, or the lack of a legal basis was perceived.\n\n14. Questions 2.1 and 2.2 only become relevant if Question 1 is answered in the affirmative. They address issues which may not immediately appear to be questions of law of fundamental importance, but rather aspects of the application of the principle of the prohibition on double patenting. As already noted in point 7. above, Question 2.1 is formulated in such a way that it may be read as seeking an answer on all conceivable criteria for applying the prohibition. However, a question of such sweeping scope would certainly be inadmissible, given that the Enlarged Board has, as a matter of principle, no powers to decide in advance on legal issues which have not yet arisen in a case before a board of appeal.\n\n15. In addition, the referral did not indicate that the Enlarged Board needs to clarify all the details of the referred questions. For example, it is not apparent that the definition of the \"same invention\" is a contentious issue in the case underlying the referral, given that the claims refused by the Examining Division are identical to the claims of the patent granted earlier (Reasons, point 3.).\n\n16. For these reasons, the Enlarged Board reads Question 2.1 narrowly, and as essentially asking whether the possible legal basis in the EPC is equally applicable to the three identified constellations, or whether there may be reasons for treating them differently, for example by establishing an exception for one of them. Further questions which may arise in connection with double patenting, such as the question of the same invention or the same applicant, are not considered to be covered by the referral.\n\n17. The Enlarged Board further notes with regard to the admissibility of Question 2.1 that the decisions cited in the context of the more specific Question 2.2. can also be considered to constitute conflicting case law for the purpose of answering Question 2.1. Thus, for example, there are decisions that view the obiter dictum of G 1/05 and G 1/06 as being restricted to divisional and parent applications (T 1423/07, Reasons, point 3.), while others view it as being more general in its scope, or at least as extending to applications linked by priority (T 2461/10, Reasons, point 14., confirmed by T 2563/11, Reasons, point 2.5).\n\n18. One reason for a possible exception from the prohibition is identified in the more specific Question 2.2. For this question, too, the Board demonstrates that conflicting decisions exist (T 318/14, Reasons, points 65.-67.). The question's formulation appears to imply that the justification for a prohibition is the principle of (the lack of) a legitimate interest, following decisions G 1/05 and G 1/06. Thus the Enlarged Board proceeds on the assumption that it may only need to give a separate answer to this question if it concludes that the constellations of Question 2.1 may be treated differently from one another and that a prohibition on double patenting is indeed to be based on the principle of a legitimate interest in the proceedings.\n\n19. The Enlarged Board is satisfied that a ruling on the referred questions (read narrowly) is necessary for the Board's decision on the appeal. The Enlarged Board also considers the structuring of the questions to be appropriate. Although the Board does not specifically say so, it can be inferred from the referring decision that, in the Board's own view, the case before it could potentially be decided at either a general level or a more specific level, depending on the answers of the Enlarged Board. This is reflected in the formulation of the referred questions.\n\n20. Summing up, the Enlarged Board is satisfied that the referral is admissible. More specifically, each of the questions is admissible, provided that the requested clarification of the conditions for a refusal is restricted to those which are inseparable from the question of the legal basis for a refusal. A reformulation of the questions is not necessary. The observations made in points 9. and 10. above on the constellations covered by Question 2.1b) and c) can be taken into account in the formulation of the answers.\n\nB. Substantive issues of the referral: Question 1.\n\nB.1 Article 125 EPC as the suggested legal basis\n\n21. The Board analysed several provisions of the Convention with respect to their suitability as the proper legal basis for the prohibition on double patenting. From the referral and the totality of the case law it is clear that Article 125 EPC is the most often discussed and, at least prima facie, the most promising one. Article 125 EPC is also given in the EPO Guidelines for Examination as the legal basis for refusals, and consequently was also invoked as such by the Examining Division in the decision under appeal. It is therefore appropriate to start with this provision.\n\nB.1.1 Applicability of Article 125 EPC to the question of double patenting\n\n22. Article 125 EPC is titled \"Reference to general principles\" and provides that \"[i]n the absence of procedural provisions in this Convention, the European Patent Office shall take into account the principles of procedural law generally recognised in the Contracting States\".\n\n23. The first question is whether the scope of Article 125 EPC or, more precisely, a procedural provision which is absent from the Convention but which may be established with the help of a principle of procedural law, may also extend to substantive issues. In the present case it can be asked if the missing, and as such hypothetical, provision which would govern the matter of double patenting could be classified as a procedural provision. Put differently, the term \"procedural provision\" requires interpretation.\n\n24. The Enlarged Board's decision G 1/97 (OJ EPO 2000, 322) on the interpretation of Article 125 EPC is of no assistance in the present case. Its finding, namely that Article 125 EPC does not permit the introduction of new procedures (Reasons, point 3.), does not provide an answer to the question whether the examination for double patenting may be covered by this article. At least, this possibility is not ruled out by G 1/97: a new procedure need not be introduced, as this examination can take place as part of the existing procedure for substantive examination under Article 94 EPC (see also point 71 of the President's comments).\n\n25. In its review of the relevant decisions, the Board tended to agree with the approach of those decisions that considered double patenting to involve both procedural and substantive issues (Reasons, point 63., referring to T 1423/07), but it did not explain in detail its reasons for this position. It also pointed out that early decisions expressly denied the possibility that Article 125 EPC could regulate matters of substantive law (Reasons, point 43., with reference to T 587/98 (OJ EPO 200,497), Reasons, points 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5)\n\n26. According to decision T 1423/07, double patenting also comprises procedural aspects, a finding which it held to be supported by the Minutes of the Munich Diplomatic Conference for the setting up of a European System for the Grant of Patents (in the following cited as R3), point 665. This source  in the reading of the deciding board  \"confirm[s] the procedural aspects of double patenting\". From this the deciding board concluded that the refusal of a European application for double patenting comprised procedural aspects as well as matters of substantive law, so that Article 125 EPC was applicable. T 1423/07 also concluded that, while some Contracting States applied the prohibition, it could not be shown to be generally recognised in the specific context of the pre-grant stage (Reasons, points 2.2.1 and 2.2.2).\n\n27. The Enlarged Board also considers that a provision falling under Article 125 EPC may well cover issues which touch upon substantive matters, such as the scope of claimed subject-matter. This interpretation can be based on the Convention itself, without reference to the preparatory documents. Thus it is not ruled out that some issues which may be considered \"substantive\" are to be decided on the basis of a principle of procedural law.\n\n28. It is settled case law of the Enlarged Board of Appeal that, even though the VCLT is not formally binding on the boards of appeal, it provides an appropriate source of international law for interpreting the Convention. This was also recognised by the referring decision in its application of Articles 31 and 32 VCLT.\n\n29. These articles are in Part III, Section 3, VCLT (titled \"Interpretation of Treaties\") and are worded as follows (with non-relevant parts omitted):\n\nArticle 31 VCLT  General rule of interpretation\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n(3) ...\n\n(4) ...\n\nArticle 32 VCLT  Supplementary means of interpretation\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n30. In view of Article 177 EPC, which provides that the three texts of the Convention, in English, French and German, are equally authentic, it is furthermore appropriate to point to Article 33 VCLT, which also belongs to Part III, Section 3:\n\nArticle 33 VCLT  Interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages\n\n1. When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.\n\n2. ...\n\n3. The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text.\n\n4. ...\n\n31. Normally, the systematic interpretation is the next method to be applied if, as a result of the grammatical (literal) interpretation, the ordinary meaning of a term remains insufficiently clear. The same principle is expressed in Article 31(1) and (2) VCLT by the statement that the terms of the treaty are to be interpreted in their context, the primary context being the text of the treaty itself.\n\n32. Article 125 EPC is in Chapter I of Part VII of the Convention (Common Provisions). This chapter is titled \"Common provisions governing procedure\". The term \"common\" refers to Parts IV to VI, i.e. the grant, opposition and appeal procedures. These parts themselves are also devoted to procedural provisions, and most articles in the common provisions of Chapter I of Part VII are clearly of a procedural nature, in the sense that they do not touch on the substantive provisions of Part II of the Convention, in particular the provisions of Chapter I of Part II (Articles 52 to 57 EPC).\n\n33. Thus it can be acknowledged that the provisions of Chapter I of Part VII are procedural in nature. The Enlarged Board is of the opinion that the minimal difference between the term \"procedural provisions\" in Article 125 EPC of Chapter I of Part VII and the wording \"provisions governing procedure\" in the Chapter's title is not intended to make a material distinction. The same applies to the German wording: \"Vorschriften über das Verfahren\" (Article 125 EPC) and \"Vorschriften für das Verfahren\" (Chapter I title). In the French version, the term \"disposition[s] de procédure\" appears in both Article 125 EPC and the title of Chapter I. On this basis, both the wording of Article 125 EPC and its position in the Convention indicate that it concerns procedural provisions comparable to the preceding articles in this chapter.\n\n34. However, Chapter I also contains Articles 123(2) and (3) EPC, which are applied daily in the Office, with the former also serving as a legal basis for a refusal under Article 97(2) EPC. Therefore, from a formal point of view, Articles 123(2) and (3) EPC are procedural provisions. On the other hand, they cannot be perceived as being purely procedural, because they require the subject-matter of the claim to be determined when they are applied in the course of examination or opposition proceedings. Notably, in G 1/05 and G 1/06 the Enlarged Board held compliance with Article 123(2) EPC to be a substantive requirement, to be examined by the Examining Division (Reasons, point 3.3).\n\n35. The above demonstrates that in the system of the EPC, the term \"procedural provision\" may well extend to provisions requiring a substantive examination of the subject-matter claimed. More particularly, provisions in Chapter I of Part VII may allow the refusal of a patent application under Article 97(2) EPC for reasons other than non-compliance with the substantive patentability requirements of Chapter I of Part II of the Convention (Articles 52 to 57 EPC).\n\n36. Thus the Enlarged Board concludes that, from a purely systematic point of view, Article 125 EPC may provide a legal basis for the regulation of double patenting - whether this means permitting or prohibiting it - even though a consideration of substantive issues such as \"the same subject-matter\" may be involved as well.\n\nB.1.2 Prohibition of or permission for double patenting as a generally recognised principle of procedural law in the practice of the Contracting States\n\n37. Since it has been concluded that Article 125 EPC may serve as the legal basis for a prohibition on double patenting, the next question is whether such a principle exists and is generally recognised in the Contracting States.\n\n38. The Enlarged Board is not aware of any reliable source which would directly confirm this proposition as a fact. The sources cited in the referring decision (Reasons, point 60.) or in the comments of the President of the EPO, e.g. the regularly updated compilations by the EPO of the relevant provisions of national law (cited as N5 in the referring decision), only document the practice of the Contracting States concerning the implementation of Article 139(3) EPC, but cannot provide direct information about their practice on double patenting in the narrow sense, i.e. about the possibility of granting two national patents, analogously to double patenting in the context of European patents only, as explained in point 2. above. It appears that the Office can do no more than infer from the general practice on the interpretation of Article 139(3) EPC that the double patenting prohibition is also a generally recognised principle (points 80. and 81. of the President's comments). The above-cited facts are certainly consistent with the assumption that the prohibition on double patenting in the narrow sense is also recognised and applied in the majority of the Contracting States. Still, it remains the case that there are no data available to the Enlarged Board which would allow it to safely establish the practice in all or at least the majority of the Contracting States and therefore to confirm the applicability of the prohibition under Article 125 EPC on that basis.\n\nB.1.3 The prohibition as an embodiment of the principle of a legitimate interest in the proceedings (implications of G 1/05 and G 1/06)\n\n39. The President of the EPO submitted that the obiter dictum of the Enlarged Board in G 1/05 and G 1/06 approved the practice of the Office. The EPO Guidelines for Examination in their present version (March 2021) also refer to those decisions in connection with double patenting, see Guidelines, G-IV 5.4. Although that particular part of the Guidelines is not quoted in point 93. of the President's comments, at point 94. G 1/05 and G 1/06 seem to be associated with the proposition that the necessity of having a legitimate interest in the proceedings is a generally recognised principle of procedural law in the Contracting States. However, in those decisions the Enlarged Board did not explain in what way the prohibition on double patenting should be derived from the principle of a legitimate interest. This is understandable, given that G 1/05 and G1/06 were not directed to this specific question. The Enlarged Board furthermore did not seem to be relying on Article 125 EPC when it stated its acceptance that the \"principle of prohibition exists on the basis of the lack of legitimate interest in the proceedings leading to a second patent\" and concluded from this that the practice of the EPO was not objectionable (G 1/05 and G 1/06, Reasons, point 3.14). Nor was there even a statement by the Enlarged Board that it regarded a legitimate interest in the proceedings to be a generally recognised principle of procedural law, which might have allowed the inference that Article 125 EPC should apply. In fact, the only firm conclusion which may be drawn from the Enlarged Board's obiter remarks in G 1/05 and G 1/06 is that the lack of a legitimate interest may provide an explanation for the prohibition.\n\n40. Furthermore, the Enlarged Board's statement in the Reasons, point 13.4, that it \"accepts\" the existence of the prohibition and that the practice of the Office did not appear objectionable must be seen in context, in particular that of point 13.5 of the Reasons. There the Enlarged Board explained, with reference to the submissions of the President of the EPO (point VIII(d). in G 1/05 and G 1/06) that recognising the prohibition could not prevent applicants from keeping a series of divisional applications pending while containing the same subject-matter. The conclusion reached by the Enlarged Board in point 13.5 would have applied a fortiori if the Office had not applied the prohibition. Thus the Enlarged Board had no reason to question the Office's practice, because confirming it was not required for the purposes of its own decision. Nor was the practice of the Office called into question in the case law at that time, even by decision T 587/98 (supra), which was cited by the referring decision (Reasons, point 43.) as questioning the applicability of Article 125 EPC to questions of substantive law. In fact, T 587/98 carefully restricted its findings to the question of a broader claim wholly encompassing a narrower claim in cases of divisional applications (Headnote and Reasons, point 3.7), but it did not go so far as to cast doubt on the general principle of a prohibition on double patenting.\n\n41. Accordingly, unreservedly approving the double patenting prohibition on the basis of the obiter dictum in G 1/05 and G 1/06 would not be appropriate for the purpose of the present referral.\n\n42. In sum, from the foregoing (points 38. to 41.) alone, the Enlarged Board is unable to conclude that the prohibition on double patenting is a principle generally recognised in the Contracting States. It is therefore necessary to have recourse to other sources.\n\nB.2 Recourse to the preparatory documents of the Convention (the \"travaux préparatoires\")\n\n43. The referring decision discussed whether the provisions of the VCLT could justify turning to the preparatory documents of the EPC for guidance. The Board held that under Article 32 in conjunction with Article 31 VCLT it was not possible to do so for the present case. This appears to have been because it found that neither condition of Article 32 VCLT was fulfilled. That is, for the issue of double patenting, an interpretation of the Convention, here Article 125 EPC, using the rules of interpretation laid down in Article 31 VCLT did not (a) leave its meaning ambiguous or obscure, or (b) lead to an obviously nonsensical (i.e. absurd) or unreasonable result (Reasons, point 59.). At least, no other conclusion can be drawn from the Board's statements there that \"[t]he majority opinion set out in point 665 of document M/PR/I cannot be relied on ... as a supplementary means of interpretation\" and that \"neither of these alternatives [conditions (a) and (b) of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention] applies to the point of law under consideration\".\n\n44. The EBA concurs with the Board's findings with respect to condition (b): as is clear from the whole context of the underlying case, the EPC may permit or it may prohibit double patenting. Neither possibility is obviously nonsensical or unreasonable. Granting two or more patents on the same invention to the same applicant may appear highly undesirable, but it is difficult to view it as outright nonsensical or clearly unreasonable. With regard to the other option, i.e. the status quo as set out in the Guidelines for Examination, it has never been argued that the practice of the Office is obviously nonsensical or unreasonable, but simply that it lacks a proper legal basis. It has never been argued either that the existing practice is in any way manifestly unjust. Thus the Enlarged Board agrees that condition (b) is not applicable.\n\n45. However, it is difficult to see why the ordinary means of interpretation pursuant to Article 31 VCLT do not leave the meaning of the Convention ambiguous or even obscure with respect to double patenting. It is clear from the referral that over thirty years of case law have not been able to settle the issue. The ambiguity of the Convention with respect to the question of double patenting is also implicitly confirmed by those decisions that have dealt with the questions of the same applicant or the same invention (see e.g. T 1391/07, Reasons, point 2.5, T 1780/12, Reasons, points 8.-10., T 879/12, Reasons, point 13., and the further decisions cited there). The fact that these questions were examined indicates that the deciding boards could not have been fully convinced that there is no prohibition on double patenting under the EPC. Had they been convinced, it would not have been proper for them to decide on the questions of the same invention and the same applicant, as these questions would have been irrelevant.\n\n46. The Enlarged Board does not endorse the opinion that the interpretation of the Convention (in itself) provides a clear answer. It rather takes the view that Article 125 EPC is worded in such general terms that, for this reason alone, its potential scope can be considered to be ambiguous. As explained in point 36. above, based on a systematic interpretation, the regulation of double patenting does not seem to be excluded from the scope of Article 125 EPC. Thus the Convention is not clear, but rather silent on this issue. The result of a systematic interpretation may still require confirmation. Accordingly, it is not at all apparent why supplementary means of interpretation, and in particular the preparatory documents of the EPC, cannot or should not be used in order to determine the position under the Convention or the meaning of Article 125 EPC with regard to double patenting. On the contrary, there are good reasons, including on the basis of Article 32 VCLT, for consulting the travaux préparatoires. Indeed, as the cited cases show, in the past both the boards and the Enlarged Board have turned to the travaux préparatoires as a matter of course for assistance in interpreting Article 125 EPC.\n\nB.2.1 Double patenting in light of the travaux préparatoires\n\n47. In the following, reference will be made to certain documents among the preparatory documents of the Convention. The references used are listed below. They replace the usual full references for the sake of brevity, and also the numbering N1 to N4 used by the appellant and in the referring decision because parts of the travaux préparatoires that were not included in the extracts filed by the appellant will also be referred to.\n\nR1: A collection of the comments by the participating governments and other bodies on the draft provisions of the future Patent Convention, as established by the 6th meeting of the Inter-Governmental Conference for the setting up of a European System for the Grant of Patents, held in Luxembourg from 19 to 30 June 1972 (in short: the 6th Meeting). The comments are listed as \"M9 to M29\" in the documentation maintained by the European Patent Office on the travaux préparatoires. R1 also contains the extract filed as N2 in the referral proceedings.\n\nR2: The Minutes of the 6th meeting of the Inter-Governmental Conference, listed by the EPO as BR/219 e/72. It contains N4.\n\nR3: The Minutes of the Diplomatic Conference, titled \"Minutes MDC 1973\" in the EPO documentation (English version). It contains N1.\n\nR4: The Minutes of the 10th meeting of Working Party I of the Inter-Governmental Conference, listed by the EPO as BR/144 e/71. It contains N3.\n\nM/34: The Draft Rules of Procedure of the Diplomatic Conference. The reference used by the EPO is maintained. It is to be noted that this Draft was adopted without amendments and became the final Rules of Procedure, see R3, point 10, page 13.\n\nThese documents are also accessible to the public via the website of the EPO (see https://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/epc/archive/epc-1973/traveaux/documents.html, at the time of writing).\n\n48. It appears undisputed that the last recorded statement on the present issue of the competent legislator, the Diplomatic Conference, is the agreement in point 665. of R3. The significance of this agreement must be evaluated in light of the legislative work done both at and before the Diplomatic Conference. Before looking at the preparatory work of the Convention dating back even earlier, for the purpose of answering Question 1 it is sufficient to start with the 6th Meeting.\n\n49. By the time of the 6th and final Meeting in June 1972, Article 125 already had its present wording and numbering, and consequently was also part of the Draft Convention after the closure of the Inter-Governmental Conference following the 6th Meeting. It was clear that the documents adopted by the Inter-Governmental Conference would form the basis of the work of the planned Diplomatic Conference (R1, Introduction, point 4, last paragraph).\n\nB.2.1.1 Minutes of the 6th Meeting (R2)\n\n50. As acknowledged in the referring decision, a common understanding was already reached during the discussions on Article 125 at the 6th meeting that double patenting was not possible (Reasons, point 56., referring to N4). This common understanding was recorded in R2 under point 49. The exact wording is as follows:\n\n\"Article 125\n\n49. During discussion of this Article the Conference established that the European Patent Office may not grant more than one European patent to the same person for the same invention being the subject of applications filed on the same date.\n\nThe Conference also established that the European Patent Office is entitled to correct any slips which it may make.\"\n\nApart from these two issues (i.e. the double patenting prohibition and error correction ex officio), no further details are recorded in R2 of the discussions concerning Article 125.\n\n51. The participating governments and bodies were invited to submit comments on the drafts, including the Draft Convention (R1, Introduction, points 4 and 6). Comments that were received before 15 May 1973 were published by the German Government in preparation for the Diplomatic Conference (R1, Introduction, point 6). Comments on Article 125 by two participating governments are known to the Enlarged Board.\n\nB.2.1.2 M/28, Comments by the Norwegian Government in R1\n\n52. Norway took part in the Inter-Governmental Conference from the beginning (R1, Introduction, point 2) and submitted comments. The complete submission of the Norwegian Government in M/28 is on pages 341-349 of R1; it was received by the Secretariat on 5 May 1973. The comment on Article 125 is in point 11 of M/28 (R1, page 346). The English version is worded as follows:\n\n\"In connection with Art. 125 the sixth meeting of the Inter-Governmental Conference \"established that the European Patent Office may not grant more than one European patent to the same person for the same invention being the subject of applications filed on the same date\" (Minutes par. 49). However, in the Norwegian opinion, it follows from Art. 52(3) that applications filed on the same day do not at all constitute novelty hindrance against each other and that an applicant may thus without detriment to himself file several applications on the same day. Under the circumstances, a possible restriction as established at the sixth meeting should be expressly stated in the Convention.\"\n\nB.2.1.3 M/10, Comments by the UK Government in R1\n\n53. The tabular summary compiled by the Secretariat of the Diplomatic Conference of the comments contained in R1 (pages 12-14) only mentions Norway as submitting comments in the context of Article 125 (R1, page 13, right-hand column, at the bottom). In fact, the comments of the UK Government also address the issue of double patenting in the same context. Reference is made to document M/10 (pages 41 to 49 in R1). These comments of the UK delegation in M/10 were not included under Article 125 in the tabular summary in R1, given that Article 125 was not mentioned. M/10 was submitted to the Secretariat earlier than M/28, on 29 March 1973.\n\n54. M/10, point 2, is titled \"GENERAL\" and contains the following:\n\n\"We would prefer the understandings recorded under paragraph 49 of the minutes of the Conference in June 1972 to be mentioned also in the records of the Diplomatic Conference.\"\n\nThis point in M/10 apparently refers to point 49 of R2 (see point 50. above).\n\nB.2.1.4 Minutes of the Diplomatic Conference (R3), point 665.\n\n55. The work of the Diplomatic Conference was regulated by the Rules of Procedure (M/34). These were adopted unanimously at the beginning of the Conference (R3, point 10, page 13). The Rules specified the organs of the Conference: the Plenary, various Committees, Working Parties and Rapporteurs (M/34, Rules 3(2) to 3(4)). The Main Committees had to establish the draft texts, for submission to the Committee of the Whole (M/34, Rule 12(5)). The Committee of the Whole had to adopt the texts for submission to the Plenary (M/34, Rules 3(2) and 36(2)). Main Committee I was tasked with examining Part VII of the Draft Convention (M/34, Rule 12(2)), including Article 125. All government delegations were entitled to participate in all three Main Committees and in the Committee of the Whole (M/34, Rules 12(6) and 14(2)). The decisions of the various organs required a qualified (two-thirds) or simple majority of the votes, abstaining delegations being considered as not voting (M/34, Rules 36 and 37). Decisions in the Main Committees and Working Parties required a simple majority (except for reconsideration of proposals under Rule 34).\n\n56. Article 125 is dealt with in the Minutes of the Proceedings of Main Committee I, points 665. to 669., with points 665. to 668. being dedicated to the issue of double patenting, while point 669. records the unanimous opinion that the EPO may correct inadvertent errors. Point 665. is worded as follows in the English version:\n\n\"In connection with Article 125, it was established at the request of the United Kingdom delegation that there was majority agreement in the Main Committee on the following: that it was a generally recognised principle of procedural law in the Contracting States that a person can be granted only one European patent for the same invention in respect of which there are several applications with the same date of filing.\"\n\n57. On closer scrutiny, the statement as recorded in the English version \"it was established ... that it was a ... principle ... in the Contracting States that ... only one European patent [can be granted] ...\" (emphasis by the Enlarged Board) appears somewhat puzzling. A comparison with the German and French versions (see point 58. below) shows that it may be a mistranslation. An alternative explanation could be that the original English text put to the vote first mentioned the granting of only one (national) patent as the recognised principle of procedural law, from which it followed that no more than one European patent should be granted for the same invention, but that this was then shortened and thus erroneously redacted for the English version of the minutes.\n\n58. Either way, the proper interpretation of this statement is rather that it \"... followed from the ... principles of procedural law in the Contracting States that only one European patent [can be granted]...\". This is clear from the corresponding German version of the minutes (\"BerichteMUCDK\" in the EPO documentation): \"... Aus den allgemein anerkannten Grundsätzen des Verfahrensrechts der Vertragsstaaten ergibt sich, dass ... \". The French version (\"M-PR\" in the EPO documentation) conveys the same: \"... il découle des principes de procédure généralement admis dans les Etats contractants qu'il ... \".\n\n59. It is also apparent that the UK motion recorded in point 665. of R3 is the direct consequence of the UK's comment in M/10. The Enlarged Board is not aware that this issue is treated anywhere else in the Minutes of the Diplomatic Conference. The only fact derivable from the wording of points 665. and 666. (the latter is discussed below) is that the majority position was established and recorded. This majority agreement appears to have been established without preceding debate, as no discussion is recorded or even hinted at. This may also be concluded from the fact that FICPI's question and the UK's response on the definition of the \"same invention\" were recorded in detail (points 667. and 668. of R3). The referring decision noted that the issue was no longer mentioned by the Rapporteur of Main Committee I in his report to the Committee of the Whole (Reasons, point 58.).\n\nB.2.1.5 Minutes of the Diplomatic Conference (R3), point 666.\n\n60. According to the minutes, the Norwegian delegation made a statement after the vote on the agreement referred to in point 665. Point 666. records the statement as follows:\n\n\"The Norwegian delegation stated that it could not agree to this principle in its present general form since under Scandinavian law it was possible in theory to grant two patents to an applicant for the same invention.\"\n\n61. This statement is compatible with the fact that the agreement recorded in point 665. was a majority agreement. Otherwise, as mentioned above, there is no indication in the minutes or elsewhere in the travaux préparatoires that either double patenting or Article 125 was the subject of any further debate. Accordingly, this agreement is not only the last recorded statement of the competent legislator, but can also be taken as the expression of its final and unchanged intention on the question of double patenting.\n\nB.2.2 Interpretation of the agreement in point 665.\n\n62. The significance for the issue of double patenting of a majority agreement being reached and recorded in the minutes is not difficult to establish. In view of the wording of Article 125 EPC, and the fact that the agreement was explicitly linked to this article in the minutes, the straightforward interpretation of the agreement is that the (potential) Contracting States agreed that the prohibition on double patenting was a generally recognised principle of procedural law in the Contracting States and as such applicable under Article 125 EPC.\n\n63. In the opinion of the Enlarged Board, there can be little doubt that an agreement established among the delegations was mentioned in the records for a purpose, and that this had to be clear to all delegations. The work of a diplomatic conference for establishing an international treaty is a serious matter, in which recorded agreements must carry weight. The purpose of the agreement recorded in point 665. of R3 is clear: it was to provide an interpretation of Article 125 EPC and have the provision applied in accordance with this interpretation. As is evident from the literature (and from the preparatory documents of the Vienna Convention itself), the practice of consulting the preparatory materials in order to determine the legislative intent behind treaty provisions was already long established in international law, even if this practice was not always accepted without reservation.\n\nB.2.3 Reservations expressed in the referring decision\n\n64. The Board noted that the issue of double patenting arose during the discussions on Article 125 of the Convention, and that up to the Diplomatic Conference it was common ground that double patenting should not be possible. Nevertheless, the Board finally held that it could not be established beyond doubt that the prohibition on double patenting could indeed fall under Article 125 EPC or that an agreement to this effect was reached. It concluded: \"The documents of the Munich Diplomatic Conference, however, fail to demonstrate that there was still agreement on the principle ...\" (Reasons, point 58.). The Board's doubts appear to have been based on various factors emerging from the minutes: that a declaration at the Diplomatic Conference was originally planned (Reasons, point 57., referring to N3 and N4) but did not materialise, that the agreement was not reported to the Committee of the Whole, and that only a majority, not a unanimous, agreement was reached (Reasons, point 58., referring to N1, i.e. points 665. and 666. of R3).\n\n65. The Enlarged Board does not share the Board's reservations. The various factors which it mentioned in connection with the agreement of point 665., and which were also put forward by the appellant, do not cast doubt on the validity of the agreement or its applicability for the interpretation of the Convention. On the contrary, the agreement as recorded was sufficient for its purpose, it did not require additional follow-up, and there is no indication that it lost support.\n\nB.2.3.1 Lack of unanimous agreement among the contracting parties\n\n66. The referring decision came to the conclusion that the events recorded in points 665. and 666. of R3 could not demonstrate the existence of a common understanding or agreement among all Contracting States for the purposes of Article 31 VCLT, and could not be used either for establishing the prohibition in place of an express provision in the Convention through the application of Article 32 VCLT (Reasons, point 59.). This view may be correct if it is based on the premise that the events recorded in points 665. and 666. were evidence of only an attempt, and as such an unsuccessful act, to bring about a common understanding. However, in light of document M/10, it is clear that the \"establishment of the majority agreement\" was not merely an attempt, but a successful motion from the UK delegation, the primary purpose of which was to ensure the \"mentioning in the records\" of the previously established agreement on the principle of the prohibition.\n\n67. The fact that the agreement did not find unanimous support does not preclude it from being taken into account as a means of interpreting the Convention. The agreed texts of the Convention were also established by majority vote, and even the adoption of the Convention as a whole only required a two-thirds majority of the Plenary (M/34, Rules 36(1) and (2)). Each State participating in the Conference was also entitled not to sign the Convention, or to sign it with certain reservations (Article 167 EPC 1973). However, Article 125 could not be the subject of a reservation. From this it is clear that the adoption of the Convention by a Contracting State did not mean that, at the stage of the negotiations during the Diplomatic Conference, each and every Contracting State already had to agree specifically to each and every Article and Rule. The common agreement of all parties concerning the scope of the Convention as a whole was only achieved and attested by their signatures, followed by the appropriate ratification (Articles 165(1) and (2) EPC 1973, Articles 11, 12 and 14 VCLT), or by accession (Article 166 EPC 1973, Articles 11 and 15 VCLT).\n\nB.2.3.2 Intended declaration referred to in R4\n\n68. It was argued by the appellant and also mentioned in the referring decision (Reasons, point 57.) that earlier documents suggested that there was to be a declaration on double patenting, instead of an express provision in the Convention. As recorded in point 119. of R4, it was decided that such a declaration should be contained in the minutes of the Diplomatic Conference. This point of R4 is also cited in the referring decision (Reasons, point 55.). The appellant argued that the agreement referred to in point 665. of R3 was not the intended declaration because it added the condition of the same filing date. The referring decision did not endorse this argument, but does appear to have agreed with the appellant that the agreement of point 665. could not be considered to be the aforementioned declaration (Reasons, points 57. and 58.), possibly because of the lack of unanimity and the absence of any follow-up.\n\n69. In the Enlarged Board's judgement, apart from the fact that R3 does not use the word \"declaration\" but \"agreement\" in point 665, there is no apparent reason why that agreement should not be taken as the intended interpretative declaration. The UK Government's comments in M/10 make it clear that the motion of the UK delegation had the same objective as the foreseen declaration and that it effectively achieved the same result. The UK proposed that the \"understandings [established at the 6th meeting should] be mentioned also in the records of the Diplomatic Conference\". Clearly, that happened, and once the agreement of point 665. was recorded, any further declaration was unnecessary. B.2.3.3 Omission of the agreement by the rapporteur of the Main Committee I\n\n70. The foregoing conclusion also accords with the fact that the issue was no longer mentioned by the rapporteur of the Main Committee I in his report to the Committee of the Whole. The double patenting issue was discussed on several levels and occasions and the text of Article 125 remained unchanged. Establishing the agreement of the majority did not require any amendment to the text of the Convention, nor could it be seen as a resolution or recommendation, the adoption of which would have been in the competence of the Plenary (M/34, Rule 3(2)).\n\n71. The absence of any mention in the rapporteur's report to the Committee of the Whole confirms that the issue was not controversial and did not entail any serious discussion, as explained in point 59. above. Reference is made to the following account on page 183 of R3, in Chapter C, I. Preliminary Remark: \"[t]he present rapporteur considered it his duty to give the Committee of the Whole as comprehensive a survey as possible of the discussions of Main Committee I and the decisions which resulted therefrom. With this in mind items of discussion which were of lesser importance or which were more of a drafting nature have been deliberately ignored even where they led to amendments to the text\". For example, the unanimous opinion on the error correction in point 669 of R3 was not mentioned either by the rapporteur. Indeed, his report concentrates on the truly contentious issues. Given that the agreement of point 665. did not change the wording of Article 125, there was even less reason to mention it.\n\nB.2.3.4 Lack of proof of a final agreement\n\n72. The Enlarged Board sees no circumstance indicating a lack of a final agreement or any change of opinion. It is not plausible that a change of opinion on double patenting could have occurred without any record in the minutes. In connection with the agreement the only dissent recorded is the statement of the Norwegian delegation in point 666. in R3 (see point 60. above) explaining only after the majority agreement was established why it could not support the UK's proposal. The Rules of Procedure expressly provided the possibility for delegations to explain their votes, even after a vote was held (M/34, Rule 39). It follows that Norway's dissent does not imply that the issue was still open. Re-opening the debate, while possible, would have been difficult: if a delegation still wished to assert the view that the principle of the prohibition or its application by way of Article 125 was wrong, it would have had to make a proposal for reconsideration, which in turn would have required a two-thirds majority (M/34, Rule 34).\n\n73. Moreover, if the understanding with regard to the prohibition on double patenting previously established at the 6th Meeting and confirmed in point 665. of R3 had lost support, it would have deserved a mention by the rapporteur of the Main Committee I as well. The delegations in the Committee of the Whole would have had to be aware of such a situation when submitting the texts to the Plenary, likewise the delegations in the Plenary when voting for the Convention as a whole, including Article 125 in unamended form. The President of the EPO argues similarly (at point 40.) when he states that a subsequent change of view at such a late stage would have been reflected in the minutes. B.2.4 Agreement in point 665. of R3 as a supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT\n\n74. Article 32 VCLT mentions both the preparatory work of a treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion as supplementary means of interpretation. The agreement recorded in point 665. of R3 must be seen as an integral part of the legislative process, and not as intended to be a separate agreement or separate instrument of the parties possibly falling under Article 31(2)(a) or (b) VCLT and requiring the consent of all parties. If the texts of the Convention could be adopted by a two-thirds majority vote, and draft articles could be established by simple majority, it would not have made sense to expect explanatory statements to be adopted unanimously. Given that the Plenary of the Diplomatic Conference agreed to task Main Committee I with the preparation of the draft wording of Article 125 on behalf of the Plenary (the Committee of the Whole also being an organ of the Plenary, cf. M/34, Rule 3(2)), it was only logical that any interpretation of Article 125 should also be discussed in Main Committee I. Against this background, the agreement recorded in point 665. of R3 was established in accordance with the rules on decision-making which the Diplomatic Conference laid down for itself, and to that extent it is no less suitable as a means for determining the common intention of the Contracting States than any of the express provisions in the Convention.\n\n75. It is true that the agreement recorded in point 665. of R3 is neither an agreement under Article 31(2)(a) VCLT nor an instrument under Article 31(2)(b) VCLT, as also noted in the comments of the President of the EPO (at point 42.). Nevertheless, it is a suitable and admissible means for determining the intention of the contracting parties concerning the scope and meaning of Article 125 EPC, and of the Convention more generally. Since an interpretation in accordance with Article 31 VCLT alone or in conjunction with the case law cannot dispel the ambiguity surrounding the question of double patenting, the meaning of the Convention is to be determined by establishing the intention of the parties. Pursuant to Article 32(a) VCLT, this may be done by recourse to the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion.\n\n76. Summing up, the proposition that the majority agreement on double patenting as recorded in point 665. of R3 cannot be taken into account in interpreting the Convention is not tenable. The preparatory documents demonstrate with overwhelming certainty that there was a real and effective agreement that the European Patent Office should prohibit double patenting by taking into account principles of procedural law generally recognised in the Contracting States, i.e. by a direct application of Article 125 EPC. Furthermore, there must have been a common understanding among the potential signatories to the Convention that this majority agreement was made on behalf of the Plenary of the Diplomatic Conference and recorded with the purpose of defining the scope of Article 125, and that therefore the principle expressed in the agreement formed part of the Convention.\n\nB.3 Other suggestions for a legal basis\n\n77. In view of these findings, it is not necessary to examine the other provisions proposed as the proper legal basis for the prohibition on double patenting, i.e. Articles 60(1), 63(1) and 76(1) EPC. Nor is it necessary to determine the conditions for a legitimate interest in the proceedings or to examine if there is a need to fill a lacuna in the Convention. The analysis above shows that the prohibition is to be derived from the legislative intention underlying the Convention and that no lacuna exists.\n\nB.4 Consequence of the established legislative intent for Article 125 EPC\n\n78. Article 125 EPC expressly empowers and, indeed, possibly even instructs or obliges the European Patent Office to take into account (\"berücksichtigt\", \"prend en consideration\") generally recognised principles of procedural law, where the Convention is silent. Therefore, since the competent legislator, here the Diplomatic Conference, established that the prohibition on double patenting was a generally recognised principle as a question of fact, and in addition made it clear that this was a principle falling under Article 125 EPC as a matter of interpretation of the law, the Office was thereby not only empowered to apply this principle but effectively also duty-bound to do so.\n\n79. At the time of signing of the Convention, the statement of the delegations in point 665. of R3 had to be taken as proof that the principle of the prohibition on double patenting was a generally recognised principle in the Contracting States, and therefore the Office was correct to apply it from the start. No information has been brought to the Enlarged Board's attention, nor has it been argued, that this situation might have changed, for example through the accession of new Contracting States, or as a result of more recent legislation in the Contracting States. Accordingly, there is no reason to conclude that the principle is no longer to be applied by the EPO.\n\n80. Overlapping designations under Article 79 EPC are an additional precondition for the prohibition to apply. Neither the key statement in point 665. of R3 nor the previous agreement in point 49 of R2 provide an explanation of why the EPO must take this into account. However, there was no need for the records of the discussions at the Diplomatic Conference to make express mention in this context of the precondition of overlapping territorial effect because this principle was stated to originate in the Contracting States and is an inherent feature of national patents. On the other hand, the statements of Working Party I in the second and fourth paragraphs of point 118. of R4 (cited in point 90. below) show that the legislator was aware that double patenting only arises in the event of overlapping designations. Moreover, if the Office did not take this additional precondition into account, i.e. if it refused to grant a second European patent regardless of the status of the respective designations, the effect of such a strict prohibition would go beyond the scope of the original national principle and thus deprive it of its legal basis.\n\n81. For all these reasons, Question 1 is to be answered in the affirmative.\n\nC. Questions 2.1 and 2.2\n\nC.1.1 Question 2.1\n\n82. The above findings of the Enlarged Board confirm that on the question of double patenting under the EPC in the narrow sense the intent of the legislator is derivable from the preparatory documents of the Convention. According to this legislative intention, the prohibition is applicable \"for the same invention in respect of which there are several applications with the same date of filing\". In view of the general wording used, it is probable that different conditions for the constellations set out in Question 2.1 were not envisaged.\n\n83. The appellant argued that the agreement was restricted to applications with the same filing date, and for this reason the constellation of Question 2.1(c) was not covered. However, as the preparatory documents show, the final agreement referred to in point 665. of R3 was a confirmation of the earlier agreement at the 6th Meeting (point 49 of R2). The referring decision pointed out that the earlier agreement also contained the condition of the same filing date, but that this was likely to have been an inadvertent inaccuracy (Reasons, point 56.). It is reasonable to assume that this inaccuracy was taken over when the agreement in point 665. of R3 was established and recorded. As noted in point 80. above, the additional requirement that has been consistently applied by the Office, namely that the prohibition only applies where the application under examination and the already granted patent have common designated states, was not contained in the agreement of point 665. of R3 either.\n\n84. Furthermore, the agreement in point 665. of R3 is not to be read as a legal provision in the usual sense, but rather as what it was intended to be, namely the expression of a general principle. Therefore, it cannot be expected to have been formulated with the precision of a legal provision. Against this background, the Enlarged Board considers that the requirement of the same date as stated in point 665. of R3 is to be understood as the same \"effective date\", in line with the explanation in point 18. of the Reasons of the referring decision, such that applications with a common priority are also covered by the prohibition.\n\nC.1.2 Conclusions from the Minutes of the 10th Meeting of Working Party I (R4)\n\n85. That the prohibition on double patenting applies to all three of the constellations set out in referred Question 2.1 is confirmed by the parts of the preparatory work that preceded the final conclusion expressed in point 665. of R3. The Enlarged Board sees no reason to conclude, nor was any put forward in the referring decision, that those parts of the travaux préparatoires which treat the various aspects of this question, i.e. the applicability of the prohibition in the different constellations of Question 2.1, are not a reliable source for exploring the legislative intent, or that the positions expressed there were later replaced by contrary ones. Nor is there any indication in the travaux préparatoires or elsewhere that, despite mentioning no particular conditions, the final explicit statement of the legislator, i.e. the agreement recorded in point 665. of R3, was for some other reason intended not to be generally applicable. Indeed, the Board expressed the view (Reasons, point 55.) that the travaux do not seem to support any exception for European applications having different filing dates but a common priority, because, as attested by R4 (see points 117-120), the double patenting prohibition was also discussed for such applications, and not only for divisional applications. Other decisions cited in the referring decision, e.g. T 2461/10 (supra, Reasons, point 14.), came to the same conclusion.\n\n86. The Enlarged Board concurs with these findings of the referring decision and T 2461/10. Points 117. and 118. of R4 provide a clear indication that the legislator's intention to exclude protection for the same subject-matter covered not only parent-divisional pairs of applications but also applications with a common priority, because each point contains an identical statement to this effect (see also the referring decision, Reasons, point 55., where these statements are cited). Formally, point 117. is directed to divisional applications (Article 137a of the then Draft Convention), but its first paragraph already makes clear that the considerations are to be extended to parallel applications (i.e. constellation a) of Question 2.1) as well. Point 118. explicitly addresses applications with a common priority, thus demonstrating that the prohibition is also applicable to those.\n\n87. Reference is also made to the comments of the President of the EPO, point 27., and to decision T 2563/11 (supra, Reasons, points 2.4 and 2.5), where the deciding board noted that point 120 of R4 provided a more detailed explanation of why, in the context of divisional applications, a provision prohibiting claims directed to the same subject-matter had been deleted, and why this provided support for the prohibition being of a more general nature. The same conclusion was drawn by the Board in the referring decision, Reasons, point 69., in connection with its analysis of Article 76(1) EPC. A comparison of the original and the amended wording of Article 137a (European divisional applications) illustrates this point.\n\nArticle 137a(2) as approved at the 9th meeting of Working Party I (in October 1971) was worded as follows:\n\n\"(1)...\n\n(2) The claims of the earlier application and any divisional application shall exclude the matter for which protection is sought by any of the other applications. Where possible, the description and drawings of each application shall relate only to the matter for which protection is sought by that application. However, when it is necessary for an application to describe the matter for which protection is sought by another application, it shall include a cross-reference to that other application.\" (source: BR/134 e/71, cf. Introduction, point 2, explaining that this draft was the outcome of the 9th meeting of Working Party I and that it would be discussed at the 10th meeting; also cited in the referring decision, Reasons, point 54.)\n\nFollowing the deletions made at the 10th Meeting, Article 137a(2) had this wording:\n\n\"(2) Where possible, the description and drawings of the earlier and any divisional application shall relate only to the matter for which protection is sought by the respective application. However, when it is necessary for an application to describe the matter for which protection is sought by another application, it shall include a cross-reference to that other application.\" (source: BR/139 e/71, cf. R4, point 4)\n\n88. Considered in isolation, the deletions from the wording of Article 137a of the Draft Convention may not point to a general prohibition on double patenting, but could on the contrary appear to endorse the possibility of claiming identical subject-matter. However, the correct explanation is to be found in the aforementioned point 120. of R4, and in this regard, rather than the English text (quoted by the President of the EPO in point 27. of his comments), it is more instructive to look at the German version (BR/144 d/71): \"Um einem Umkehrschluss aus Artikel 137 a Absatz 2 vorzubeugen, der dahin gehen könnte, dass - ausser bei Teilanmeldungen - die Patentansprüche späterer Anmeldungen denselben Gegenstand enthalten dürfen wie die Ansprüche früherer Anmeldungen, beschloss die Arbeitsgruppe, Satz 1 dieser Bestimmung zu streichen.\" Thus the German version makes it clearer that the deletion was meant to prevent any inverse conclusion that only divisional applications had to be directed to different subject-matter, whereas other applications of the same applicant were permitted to claim the same invention. The French version (BR/144 f/71) conveys the same sense as the German. Thus point 120. of R4 is consistent with the conclusion of the Enlarged Board's above reasoning that the prohibition on double patenting is general and applies to all the constellations of Question 2.1.\n\n89. Thus the Enlarged Board considers that the travaux préparatoires do not point to any special circumstance or condition inherent in the identified constellations which would lead to the conclusion that any of the three constellations should be treated differently from the others with respect to the prohibition on double patenting. This gives the answer to Question 2.1.\n\n90. The appellant also argued that the last sentence in the fourth paragraph of point 118. of R4 suggests that in cases of internal priority the legislator accepted an extended term of protection in respect of states designated in both the priority and the subsequent application. The following is stated there: \"The Working Party came to the conclusion that even when an applicant claimed the priority of an earlier European patent application, he should not be able to obtain the same patent twice for the same invention in the same designated States. It was not necessary, however, to provide a rule to this effect in the Convention. Under the present version of the Paris Convention, there would have to be an extended term for those States which were designated twice\".\n\n91. However, this statement has to be read together with the condition described at the end of the second paragraph of point 118. of R4, namely the assumption that the earlier application would have been withdrawn in the meantime: \"The majority of the delegations considered that Article 73 of the Convention [Priority right, essentially corresponding to Article 87 EPC 1973 and Article 87 EPC 2000] did not in principle prevent an applicant from claiming the priority of an earlier European patent application, while Article 8 of the PCT in fact makes provision for this in respect of international applications. It did appear doubtful whether a State which had been designated in the earlier application could be designated again in the later European application, as this could lead to the term of the patent being extended by the time between the filing of the two applications in the case of the earlier application being withdrawn during that time\" (emphasis by the Enlarged Board). In the third paragraph of point 118. the Working Party established that the problem of an extended term was likely to disappear due to expected amendments to the Paris Convention (mentioned as the \"Paris Union\"). As a result, the extended term referred to can be understood as a combination of the term of protection under Article 64(1) EPC with that of provisional protection under Article 67(1) EPC (at that time Articles 18 and 19, which essentially corresponded to the articles of the EPC 1973 and the present articles). In light of this, the statement of the Working Party relied on by the appellant does not concern the situation of double patenting in the narrow sense, nor does it contradict the Working Party's preceding explicit statement that a second patent cannot be granted for the same invention even in the case of internal priority.\n\nC.2 Question 2.2\n\n92. In light of the above findings, it is clear that the legislator's intention with respect to the prohibition on double patenting also extends to applications having a common priority. As stated above, the answer to Question 2.1 is that the prohibition applies to all three constellations identified. It follows that Question 2.2 does not require a separate answer.",
         "Order, For these reasons, it is decided that the questions referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal are answered as follows:, 1. A European patent application can be refused under Articles 97(2) and 125 EPC if it claims the same subject-matter as a European patent which has been granted to the same applicant and does not form part of the state of the art pursuant to Article 54(2) and (3) EPC., 2.1 The application can be refused on that legal basis, irrespective of whether it, a) was filed on the same date as, or, b) is an earlier application or a divisional application (Article 76(1) EPC) in respect of, or, c) claims the same priority (Article 88 EPC) as the European patent application leading to the European patent already granted., 2.2 In view of the answer to Question 2.1 a separate answer is not required.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The Opposition Division revoked European patent No. 2100615 with its decision dated 5 February 2018, and the patent proprietor filed an appeal against this decision (appeal number T 967/18). The present appeal proceedings concern a decision which was taken subsequently, namely the decision of the Legal Division dated 9 July 2021 on the interruption of the opposition proceedings under Rule 142 EPC, against which the opponent appealed.\n\nII. By submission dated 19 July 2019, the patent proprietor informed the Legal Division that Biotempus Ltd. had, on 21 February 2017, assigned the patent to HHKM KH Pty Ltd. which had, on 14 March 2017, changed its name to Biotempus Pty Ltd. The patent proprietor further stated that an external administrator for Biotempus Ltd. had been appointed on 26 September 2016, in the context of the company entering voluntary administration.\n\nIII. By communication dated 26 July 2019, the Legal Division declared that the opposition proceedings had been interrupted as from 11 November 2016 (i.e. as from the day after the expiry of the opposition period) and that the proceedings would be resumed on 4 November 2019. By submission dated 24 October 2019, the opponent requested that the Legal Division set aside the interruption of the proceedings or, alternatively, that it set 21 February 2017 as the date of resumption of the proceedings. After issuing a communication and holding oral proceedings, the Legal Division issued the decision under appeal.\n\nIV. In its statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant essentially argued that the parties concerned had to be heard before an interruption is declared by the Legal Division. A preventive measure with immediate effect without hearing the parties beforehand might be justified in the case of a stay of proceedings pursuant to Rule 14 EPC, but not in the case of an interruption of proceedings pursuant to Rule 142 EPC. While a stay of proceedings was only ever ordered with respect to the future, an interruption of proceedings had retroactive effect. By not hearing the opponent before ordering the interruption of proceedings, the Legal Division had violated the opponent's right to be heard and its expectation to be given a means to challenge the lawfulness of an interruption before it is ordered.\n\nV. Moreover, the appellant questioned whether the requirements for an interruption of proceedings pursuant to Rule 142(1)(b) EPC had been fulfilled. There had been no bankruptcy proceedings and the appointment of an external administrator had not legally prevented the patent proprietor from continuing the proceedings. As in J 11/95 and T 54/17, the patent proprietor had also factually continued the proceedings. Moreover, contrary to what was required according to T 854/12, the Legal Division had not fully examined whether the factual requirements for an interruption had been met, including with regard to a possible abuse of rights by the patent proprietor.\n\nVI. As to the auxiliary request that 21 February 2017 be set as the date of resumption of the proceedings, the appellant mainly argued that the external administrator had on 21 February 2017 assigned the patent on behalf of Biotempus Ltd. (the former patent proprietor) to the current patent proprietor and respondent (at the time called HHKM KH Pty Ltd.). Accordingly, the alleged legal incapacity of Biotempus Ltd. had no longer been relevant as of this date. A resumption as of this earlier date would serve legal certainty and procedural economy. Delays in informing the EPO about changes relating to the patent as an object of property fell entirely within the sphere of the proprietor and should not be detrimental to the legitimate interests of the public and the opponent.\n\nVII. The respondent (patent proprietor) did not file a reply to the opponent's statement of grounds of appeal. It did not participate in the present appeal proceedings in any other way either.\n\nVIII. The Board issued a communication under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020 and held oral proceedings by videoconference on 23 November 2022.\n\nIX. In the oral proceedings before the Board, the appellant stated that a potentially far-reaching \"eraser effect\" distinguished an interruption of proceedings under Rule 142 EPC from a stay of proceedings under Rule 14 EPC. In the present case, this \"eraser effect\" led to the wiping out of the entire opposition and appeal proceedings. Therefore, the Legal Division had to establish beyond doubt that the requirements for an interruption of proceedings were met, and had to hear the parties before declaring such an interruption. In the oral proceedings before the Board, the appellant also questioned, for the first time in the entire proceedings, the Legal Division's competence to declare an interruption of the proceedings under Rule 142 EPC.\n\nX. The appellant's final requests were that the decision of the Legal Division and the interruption of the proceedings be set aside and that the case be remitted to the Legal Division (main request) or, as an auxiliary request, that the decision of the Legal Division be set aside and 21 February 2017 be set as the date of resumption of the proceedings. The appellant further requested the reimbursement of the appeal fee due to a substantial procedural violation.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. Competence to declare the interruption of proceedings\n\n1.1 Under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC, proceedings before the EPO must be interrupted if the applicant or patent proprietor is prevented by legal reasons from continuing the proceedings as a result of an action taken against their property.\n\n1.2 Under Article 20(1) EPC, the Legal Division is responsible for decisions in respect of entries in the European Patent Register. The European Patent Register must contain, under Article 127(1) EPC in conjunction with Rule 143(1)(t) EPC, inter alia entries on dates of interruption and resumption of proceedings under Rule 142 EPC.\n\n1.3 An applicant or patent proprietor may be involved in a multitude of proceedings before the EPO, possibly before different types of departments within the meaning of Article 15 EPC, such as examining divisions, opposition divisions or (multiple) boards of appeal. However, regardless of the number of proceedings affected, the question of whether or not the conditions of an interruption under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC are fulfilled depends on the legal status of a single applicant or patent proprietor. This legal status must be determined on a set of facts which is usually identical in all proceedings affected.\n\n1.4 The EPOrg is an intergovernmental organisation governed by the rule of law (G 3/19, Reasons XXV.1; see also G 3/08, Reasons 7.2.3), which requires predictability of jurisdiction and also a certain degree of uniformity in the application of the law. Therefore, although it may not always be possible to achieve this due to a lack of binding effect (see T 854/12, Reasons 1.2.6), the EPO should endeavour to avoid conflicting decisions on the interruption of proceedings under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC which concern the same applicant or patent proprietor and the same set of facts in multiple proceedings.\n\n1.5 A risk of conflicting final decisions exists even in the absence of multiple pending proceedings. In the present case, the EPO became aware of facts relevant to an interruption under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC when an appeal was already pending before a technical board of appeal which had not yet, however, started the examination of the appeal on the merits. The Legal Division then issued a communication declaring the interruption of the proceedings, followed by an appealable decision. Pursuant to Article 21(2) EPC, the review of this decision falls under the exclusive responsibility of the Legal Board of Appeal. In such circumstances, it is possible that the Legal Board of Appeal and the Technical Board of Appeal both consider on the merits whether or not the present opposition appeal proceedings were interrupted, and come to different conclusions.\n\n1.6 In T 1389/18, Reasons 6, the Technical Board of Appeal distinguished between the decision of the Opposition Division, against which the appeal before it had been filed, and the Legal Division's later communication declaring the interruption of the proceedings. The Board considered the latter not to be encompassed by the appeal against the Opposition Division's decision. While the present case differs from T 1389/18 in that the appeal proceedings before the Technical Board of Appeal were already pending when the Legal Division issued its communication, the approach taken in T 1389/18 avoids two conflicting final decisions of boards of appeal being taken on the same legal question concerning the same patent.\n\n1.7 In conclusion, the Board agrees with the finding in T 1389/18, Reasons 4, that the Legal Division has the power to determine an interruption of the proceedings, which was as a result also confirmed in J 10/19, Reasons 6. As such, this power was not denied in T 854/12, Reasons 1.2.2 and 1.2.3, either, where it was only concluded that the Legal Division's power in that regard was not exclusive.\n\n2. Interruption of proceedings due to the appointment of an external administrator\n\n2.1 The conditions for an interruption under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC, i.e. that the patent proprietor was, as a result of an action taken against its property, prevented by legal reasons from continuing the proceedings, were fulfilled in the present case.\n\n2.2 The appellant argued that the appointment of an external administrator did not result in the respondent being prevented by legal reasons from continuing the proceedings. It essentially referred to the voluntary nature of the external administrator's appointment and the absence of a bankruptcy judgment.\n\n2.3 The Legal Division's finding in view of the documents annexed to the respondent's submission dated 19 July 2019 that an external administrator was appointed in line with the provisions of the Australian Corporations Act was not contested by the appellant. Under the Australian Corporations Act, a company may be placed into external administration if it is experiencing financial problems. In such a situation, an external administrator may, as in the present case, be appointed voluntarily by the company's directors, or involuntarily by its creditors. In both cases, the interests of creditors are involved. As to voluntary external administration, Section 436A of the Australian Corporations Act states that a company's directors may appoint an external administrator if, in their opinion, \"the company is insolvent, or is likely to become insolvent at some future time\".\n\n2.4 Once appointed, voluntarily or involuntarily, according to Section 437D of the Australian Corporations Act only the external administrator can deal with a company's property. Any transaction or dealing affecting company property is void if it is not entered into or consented to by the administrator (unless the transaction or dealing was entered into under an order of the court). This also corresponds to the external administrator's letter to the former patent proprietor's solicitor dated 29 September 2016, in which he stated that all active files and actions now \"fall under my control\".\n\n2.5 Hence, the mere fact that there was no bankruptcy judgement and that the former patent proprietor entered voluntarily into external administration under the Australian Corporations Act does not speak against the application of Rule 142(1)(b) EPC in the present case. Rather, as the disputed patent was part of the former patent proprietor's company property at the relevant point in time, the former patent proprietor was indeed \"prevented by legal reasons from continuing the proceedings\" within the meaning of Rule 142(1)(b) EPC. The Board also notes that the company placed into external administration was ultimately liquidated.\n\n3. Purpose and effect of an interruption of proceedings\n\n3.1 If the relevant conditions are fulfilled, an interruption of proceedings under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC occurs directly by operation of law. Hence, the Legal Division's communication dated 26 July 2019 on the interruption of proceedings was not constitutive in this regard; rather, it only had declaratory effect (see T 854/12, Reasons 1.1.1).\n\n3.2 The interruption of proceedings under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC as a matter of law ensures that an applicant or patent proprietor cannot validly dispose of the application or patent in proceedings before the EPO when legal action according to Rule 142(1)(b) EPC is taken against their property. This protects third parties such as creditors from possibly detrimental dispositions of the applicant or patent proprietor (see T 1389/18, Reasons 8). Against this background, the purpose of Rule 142 EPC should not be considered as only consisting in the protection of the applicant or patent proprietor (as was stated in T 854/12, Reasons 6.1, and T 54/17, Reasons 1.5).\n\n3.3 In view of the purpose underlying Rule 142(1)(b) EPC as explained above, the effect of an interruption of proceedings is not limited to certain periods being interrupted as specified in Rule 142(4) EPC. Rather, after the interruption has taken effect, procedural acts undertaken by the parties which do not concern the situation created by the interruption - like in the present proceedings the question of whether there actually was an interruption - are invalid. The same principle applies to acts, including decisions, taken by the EPO during the time of interruption.\n\n3.4 In T 1389/18, Reasons 7, it was accordingly held that the decision announced by the opposition division during the period of interruption was null and void. In the present case, it will be up to the Technical Board of Appeal in case T 967/18 to assess this matter.\n\n4. Factual continuation of the proceedings by the patent proprietor\n\n4.1 Whether or not the patent proprietor continued the opposition proceedings factually during the period of interruption is irrelevant under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC, as this provision is only concerned with whether the patent proprietor was legally able to continue the proceedings (see T 1389/18, Reasons 8, last sentence). In particular, the mere fact that an applicant or patent proprietor continues proceedings before the EPO does not allow any conclusions to be drawn as to whether or not they were legally prevented from doing so. The interruption of proceedings under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC by force of law rather ensures that acts undertaken by applicants or patent proprietors which continue the proceedings even though they are not legally allowed to do so are invalid - and therefore cannot be detrimental to the legitimate interests of third parties.\n\n4.2 The Board does not understand J 11/95, Reasons 5.3, as relying merely on the factual continuation of the proceedings by the applicant to arrive at the conclusion that the applicant was legally not prevented from doing so. If that were the case, the Board would disagree. However, it rather seems that the Board in case J 11/95 was of the opinion that, in view of the evidence provided, national bankruptcy had in this specific case not legally prevented the company concerned from continuing the proceedings before the EPO.\n\n5. Alleged abuse of rights\n\n5.1 As to the alleged abuse of rights by the respondent, the Board notes that the burden of proof for an abuse of rights lies with the party claiming the abuse of rights, and that such an abuse must be established beyond doubt. It may in particular constitute an abuse of rights if a legal right is exercised predominantly to cause harm instead of for legitimate purposes (J 14/19, Reasons 13.1). An interruption of proceedings under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC, however, does not occur due to the exercise of any \"right\" of the applicant or patent proprietor. It occurs directly by operation of law and, as explained in point 3.2 above, also protects the legitimate interests of third parties, in particular creditors. The Board also notes that the respondent did not request interruption.\n\n5.2 Having said that, it was nevertheless unfortunate that the respondent only informed the EPO by letter of 19 July 2019 about having entered into voluntary administration almost three years before. Had the respondent informed the EPO in a more timely manner, the impact of the interruption could have been less severe.\n\n6. Interruption not subject to discretion\n\n6.1 Whether proceedings \"shall be interrupted\" under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC is not a discretionary decision of the deciding body (J 18/12, Reasons 10). Rather, an interruption of proceedings only depends on whether or not the conditions referred to in Rule 142 EPC are met (see J 10/19, Reasons 11 and 12, which did not consider T 54/17 to be of any general relevance in this respect, with which the Board agrees). Hence, it is not necessary to consider and weigh the specific individual interests involved before declaring an interruption of the proceedings. Accordingly, the Legal Division did not have to establish additional facts regarding the specific interests of the parties.\n\n7. No retroactive effect of setting a declaration of interruption aside\n\n7.1 Allowing the appellant's main request that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the proceedings be interrupted from 11 November 2016 to 4 November 2019 would require that the interruption is set aside with retroactive effect. The same is true of the appellant's auxiliary request that the decision under appeal be set aside and that 21 February 2017 - i.e. a date in the past - be set as the new date of resumption of the proceedings.\n\n7.2 According to case law, it is not possible to set aside a declaration of interruption by the Legal Division with retroactive effect, not even if it was declared erroneously (for an interruption see T 1389/18, Reasons 6, and J 10/19, Reasons 4 to 13; for a stay see J 14/19, Reasons 3.5, with further references). Following this case law, the appellant's main and auxiliary requests could not be allowed for that reason alone. There would be no point in ordering a resumption of proceedings in the near future either, as the proceedings were already resumed by the Legal Division itself as from 4 November 2019.\n\n7.3 The reasons invoked in the case law cited above include that otherwise time limits which had been declared by the Legal Division to be interrupted could, from the parties' perspectives, be shortened or expire retroactively (see J 10/19, Reasons 5). In addition, members of the public have legitimate expectations that the dates of interruption and resumption which are entered into the European Patent Register are correct (see J 10/19, Reasons 9).\n\n7.4 As the interruption in the case at hand was not declared erroneously, this matter does not need to be analysed further. However, the present Board notes that it seems to follow from the aforementioned case law that the effects of an interruption under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC can come into existence not only as a matter of law at the time of, and due to, the fulfillment of the conditions for an interruption under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC, but also - and in such cases indeed retroactively - through an erroneous declaration of interruption by the Legal Division.\n\n8. Request for reimbursement of the appeal fee due to a substantial procedural violation\n\n8.1 An interruption of proceedings under Rule 142 EPC is, in terms of its legal nature, comparable to a stay of proceedings under Rule 14 EPC (J 10/19, Reasons 5). In particular, and contrary to the appellant's assertion, the Legal Division may declare both an interruption of the proceedings under Rule 142 EPC and a stay of the proceedings under Rule 14 EPC with retroactive effect to the date on which the conditions of the respectively applicable legal provisions have been fulfilled (for an interruption see T 1389/18, Reasons 4; for a stay see J 14/19, Reasons 3.4, with further references). While the retroactive effect of an interruption under Rule 142 EPC may concern a date which is further in the past than the retroactive effect of a stay under Rule 14 EPC (as the latter concerns the date on which an allowable request was filed, see J 9/12, Reasons 11), this is a matter of degree rather than of legal nature.\n\n8.2 As to the procedure, it is established case law of the boards of appeal on a stay of proceedings under Rule 14 EPC that the applicant does not have to be heard before the Legal Division issues a communication to the applicant on the stay of proceedings. The established practice is that after notification of this communication, the applicant can challenge the stay of proceedings ordered by the Legal Division and request an appealable decision. This practice has been explained to be related to the purpose of Rule 14 EPC, which is to provide effective legal protection of the legitimate interests of the third party requesting the stay of the proceedings (see J 14/19, Reasons 3.3 and 3.4, with further references). In particular, a non-entitled applicant should be prevented from impairing the position of a third party (J 24/13, Reasons 3.4), for example by withdrawing the application or patent (see J 7/96, Reasons 8).\n\n8.3 Similar considerations apply to an interruption of the proceedings under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC. The interruption of the proceedings ensures that an applicant or patent proprietor cannot validly dispose of the application or patent in proceedings before the EPO when legal action according to Rule 142(1)(b) EPC is taken against their property (see point 3.2 above).\n\n8.4 The Legal Division is therefore not barred from issuing a communication on the interruption of the proceedings without hearing the parties beforehand as a matter of principle. However, if it does not hear the parties beforehand, it must hear them afterwards. Having heard the parties, the Legal Division must be open to arrive at a conclusion which deviates from its initial assessment. In particular, if the Legal Division considers its previous declaration erroneous, it will have to order a date of resumption of the proceedings in the immediate future. This will usually be considerably earlier than the date it initially ordered.\n\n8.5 According to the case law referred to in point 7.2 above, it may be that procedural acts which were carried out during the period for which the interruption was declared must be repeated even if the Legal Division itself, after having heard the parties, considers its previous declaration of interruption erroneous. The appellant is correct in its understanding that this can have more severe consequences in case of an interruption than in case of a stay of proceedings. This is particularly so if (almost) entire opposition proceedings have been conducted during the relevant period. In such cases, the expected legal consequences of the interruption may indeed require the Legal Division to hear the parties before issuing a declaration of interruption.\n\n8.6 Having said that, a precondition for reimbursement of the appeal fee under Rule 103(1)(a) EPC is that the appeal is allowable (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 10th edition, 2022, V.A.11.5). As the appeal is not allowable, the request for reimbursement of the appeal fee must be refused.\n\n8.7 The appellant also stated that a higher standard of proof should be applied to an interruption of the proceedings, namely that the underlying factual requirements had to be established beyond doubt. The appellant argued that in the present case only the respondent had had access to the relevant information. However, as an interruption of proceedings also serves the interests of third parties such as creditors, a deviation from the generally applicable standard of proof, i.e. the balance of probabilities, would not be justified for that reason alone.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The petition for review (\"Petition\") concerns appeal proceedings T 1160/18 of board of appeal 3.3.07 (\"the Board\"). The appeal was lodged by the Proprietor (\"the Petitioner\") against the decision of the Opposition Division to revoke the patent.\n\nII. Oral proceedings were held before the Board on 6 September 2021. At the end of the oral proceedings the Chairman of the Board announced that the appeal was dismissed. The revocation of the patent was thus confirmed.\n\nIII. The decisions of the Opposition Division and the Board in this case are solely concerned with added matter, Articles 76(1) and 123(2) EPC.\n\nIV. The structure of claim 1 of the main request before the Board was set out in the Board's communication of 17 January 2020 in preparation of the oral proceedings, (\"the Communication\") at point 16.2:\n\n\"Claim 1 is therefore a combination of the following main features:\n\na) ...\n\nb) ...\n\nc) ...\n\nd) A daily dosage of 480 mg in one to three doses\n\ne) A list of diseases to be treated.\"\n\nThis structure was followed by the Petitioner in its subsequent submissions to the Board, and by the Board in its decision. This structure is also followed in this decision.\n\nV. The Petitioner considers that its right to be heard has been violated as it was not given an opportunity to comment on the reasoning of the Board on a key issue, this issue only becoming apparent in the written decision. This reasoning is found in the last paragraph of point 1.3 on page 34 of the Board's decision, (the square brackets have been added by the Enlarged Board), which states:\n\n\"In the present case, even if there has not been a singling out from the list of disorders [feature (e)], the original lists of disorders to be treated has been significantly shrunk and, for this reason, cannot be considered to remain generic\".\n\nAccording to the Petitioner (pages 9 - 10 of the Petition):\n\n\"This objection, based on the notion that a shrunken list can be non-generic without leading to a singling out, was never raised in the Board's communication and was not explained by the Board at the oral proceedings...\n\n3.3.1\n\n... In particular, the Board has not given the parties a chance to present arguments on the standard that is to be applied in the determination of whether a shrunken list is still generic or not.\"\n\nThe Petitioner further argues, (page 11 of the Petition):\n\n\"While the Board expressed doubts [in its Communication] regarding the disclosure of feature(e) in the parent application as filed, it did not indicate that it intended to rely on a new standard for assessing the disclosure in the parent application, namely the 'significant' shrinking of a list such that the list is no longer generic.\"\n\nVI. In the Communication, the Board discussed in para 16.1 to 16.3 whether claim 1 of the main request complied with Article 76(1) EPC. In its discussion of features d) and e) of claim 1 of the main request, the Board stated:\n\n\"The feature d) is a selection among numerous possible daily dosages disclosed on page 36 of the parent application. The value of 480 mg is furthermore the restriction to a range limit.\n\nThe feature d) [sic, the Board meant feature e)] corresponds to the diseases claimed in original claims 44 or 45 with a restriction to some diseases. Original claims 44 and 45 referred however to claims 1 - 43 which object is different from present claim 1. The only possible basis for the claimed diseases can be found on the list of diseases disclosed on pages 37 - 39 of the parent application, wherein the claimed diseases constitute a selection among the list of originally disclosed diseases.\n\nConsequently, the combination of at least features a), c), d) and e) constitute a combination from selections in multiple lists and is not disclosed or derivable from the parent application ...\"\n\nVII. The Petitioner responded to the Communication with a letter dated 5 May 2020. The Petitioner noted (page 2 of its letter, fourth paragraph) that: \"... it has been argued, and the Board appears to preliminarily agree, that the combination of features of the claim of the Main Request is the result of 'selections' from 'lists' in the disclosure of the parent application\".\n\nThe Petitioner went on in its letter to discuss, amongst other things, features d) and e) of claim 1 of the main request. As regards feature d), the Petitioner gave arguments for its disclosure and concluded that a skilled person seeking to implement the invention would seriously contemplate a daily dosage of 480 mg (para 3.4, pages 7 - 8 of the letter). As regards feature e), the Petitioner noted that in the description the diseases are split into two groups and argued that the deletion of psoriasis from the first group and the exclusion of all of the second group in the main request did not lead to a singling out of any subject-matter. Although conditions had been omitted from the main request (see page 10 of the letter):\n\n\"The list of conditions remains generic. It has reduced size, which is not objectionable. It is established case law that the deletion of elements from lists, which does not lead to singling out specific elements is not objectionable ...\n\nIt is further noted that the primary focus of the invention is the treatment of autoimmune, inflammatory or hyperproliferative conditions ...\n\nThus, the treatment of the conditions of the second group is a less preferred aspect of the original disclosure. The present claim relates to the more preferred aspect.\n\nFrom the above discussion it follows that in the present case the remaining claimed subject-matter, namely the shrunk list of conditions, is directly and unambiguously disclosed in the parent application.\"\n\nVIII. The minutes of the oral proceedings before the Board record that the first matter discussed with the parties was whether the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request complied with the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC. After deliberation, the Chairman announced the conclusion of the Board that the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request did not meet the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC.\n\nIX. The written decision of the Board deals with whether the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request complies with the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC in para 1.1 to 1.5 (6 pages of reasoning). In paragraph 1.1 of the decision, (paragraph spanning pages 29 and 30), the Board states:\n\n\"According to established jurisprudence, a combination of features originally disclosed in separate embodiments or lists must emerge clearly and unambiguously from the content of the application as filed and, in case of divisional applications, also from the parent application.\"\n\nThe Board then goes on to discuss whether feature d) complies with Article 76(1) EPC. The conclusion of the Board on this issue is as follows (see last paragraph of para 1.2 on page 31 of the decision):\n\n\"Consequently, the feature 'wherein the daily dosage is 480 mg active substance given in one to three doses' constitutes an arbitrary selection among several equally ranking possibilities.\"\n\nX. The Board continues by addressing feature e) of claim 1 of the main request in para 1.3 of the decision. Para 1.3 is two and a half pages long. The Board first looks at the list of diseases to be treated as set out in claims 44 and 45 of the parent application. The Board notes that only a selection of these diseases has been taken from these claims into claim 1 of the main request. The Board then goes on to look at the disclosure on pages 37 to 39 of the disorders to be treated. This disclosure gives two lists and in addition a list of treatments in which the novel composition or kit according to the invention can be used. The Board notes on page 33 of the decision:\n\n\"The Board cannot see in the lists given in these pages any kind of hierarchical split or subdivision between a first group of preferred disorders to be treated and forming the basis of the claimed disorders, and a second group of less preferred disorders to be treated which has been excluded from the subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request, as argued by the appellant. There is indeed nothing in the wording used in the description which would indicate a preference for a list or another. Besides, the two first paragraphs of page 39 group again the indications in a single list, as do original claims 44 and 45.\"\n\nXI. In para 1.4 of the decision (page 34) the Board states that the \"shrinkage\" of a list as such is not contestable under Article 76(1) EPC, and goes on to give its reasons for finding a non-compliance with Article 76(1) EPC:\n\n\"The selection of an explicitly disclosed range value or the shrinkage of a list are, as such, not contestable under Article 76(1) EPC. However, the combination of the features resulting from these limitations must emerge directly and unambiguously from the content of the parent application. This can occur in particular, in the presence of a pointer to choose exactly such a combination of features.\n\nIn the present case, there is nothing like this. The claimed daily dosage of '480 mg' is indeed an arbitrary selection among several equally ranking limits of ranges of daily dosages, and the claimed disorders to be treated result from an arbitrary limitation of the list of original disorders to be treated. Thus, claim 1 is based on a new particular combination of features which cannot be derived directly and unambiguously from the parent application.\"\n\nXII. The Petitioner claims that a fundamental violation of the right to be heard had taken place. It was only in a position to recognise this once the written decision had been issued. The reasons given in the written decision as to why claim 1 of the main request did not comply with Article 76(1) EPC were based on reasoning and arguments that had never been put forward during the opposition and appeal proceedings.\n\nXIII. The Enlarged Board sent a communication setting out its preliminary views on the case. The Enlarged Board was of the view that the Petition was not clearly inadmissible, but was clearly unallowable.\n\nXIV. In response to said communication of the Enlarged Board, the Petitioner, without making any substantive submissions, withdrew its request for oral proceedings and requested a decision on the merits of its case.\n\nXV. The Petitioner requests that:\n\n1. the decision under review be set aside and that the proceedings before the Board of Appeal be re-opened; and\n\n2. the members of the Board of Appeal that were participating in the decision under review be replaced; and\n\n3. the fee for the petition for review be reimbursed.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The Enlarged Board considers this Petition to be a petition under Article 112a(2)(c) EPC. A petition under such a ground is only admissible if an objection in respect of the procedural defect was raised during the appeal proceedings and dismissed by the Board, except where such objection could not be raised during the appeal proceedings (Rule 106 EPC).\n\n2. The Enlarged Board takes the view that the Petitioner's objection could not have been raised until the Petitioner had read the written decision of the Board.\n\n3. The Petition is therefore not clearly inadmissible\n\n4. However, the Enlarged Board considers the Petition to be unallowable.\n\n5. The Petitioner's case is that the Board violated its right to be heard as it had no opportunity to present arguments specifically addressing the issue of the standard that is to be applied in the determination of whether a shrunken list is still generic or not - see point V. above.\n\n6. On pages 15 and 16, para 3.3.7 of the Petition, the Petitioner argues that if it had been able to present arguments that the definition of feature e) is not based on a significant shrinking of the original list of disorders and that hence the list could be considered to remain generic, this would have led to a different outcome. That is, that the Board would have had to conclude that claim 1 of the main request met the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC. The Enlarged Board does not agree, it is of the view that this issue was not relevant to the Board's decision and that the last paragraph of para 1.3 of the decision is obiter. For ease of reference, the last paragraph of para 1.3 reads as follows:\n\n\"In the present case, even if there has not been a singling out from the list of disorders, the original lists of disorders to be treated has been significantly shrunk and, for this reason, cannot be considered to remain generic.\"\n\nThe Enlarged Board reaches this conclusion due to the presence of the words \"even if\" in this paragraph; due to the para 1.4, which immediately follows the above quoted text; and due to the fact that para 1.3 sets out in two and a half pages detailed reasoning why there has been a singling out from the list of disorders.\n\nIt is to be noted that the first paragraph of para 1.4 acknowledges that shrinking a list is not objectionable in itself, see point XI. above, and the second paragraph of para 1.4 states that a shrinking of a list is not the issue being dealt with.\n\nIf the last paragraph of para 1.3 were to be deleted from the decision, the decision would still be complete, logical, reasoned and understandable.\n\n7. The Enlarged Board thus considers the \"significantly shrunk\" argument to be only one of two objections upon which the Board found that the request did not comply with Article 76(1) EPC. Thus even if the Petitioner had established a procedural violation in respect of this objection, there would have been no causal link between that violation and the decision. By a causal link, the Enlarged Board means that it cannot be ruled out that a different decision would have been reached if a party had been heard on the point on which it alleges its right to be heard had been infringed. Thus any violation of the right to be heard in respect of this objection cannot be considered as being fundamental (see R 19/09, reasons 6 to 9.2).\n\n8. The Enlarged Board notes that the Board's reasoning in its decision for finding non-compliance with Article 76(1) EPC, set out in point XI. above, is the same as the reasoning set out in the Board's Communication, see point VI. above. The Enlarged Board further notes that the Petitioner specifically addressed these points in its letter of 5 May 2020, see point VII. above.\n\n9. Decisions of a board of appeal may only be based on grounds or evidence on which the parties have had an opportunity to present their comments (Article 113(1) EPC). This implies that a party may not be taken by surprise by references in the reasons for the decision, to unknown grounds or evidence. Grounds or evidence under Article 113(1) EPC is to be understood as the essential legal and factual reasoning on which a decision is based (see decision R 16/13, reasons 3.3). A party must have an opportunity to comment on the decisive aspects of the case. For the reasons set out above, the Enlarged Board considers that these requirements have been fulfilled.\n\n10. On page 3 of the Petition, the Petitioner states that the Opposition Division did not apply the correct legal standard under Article 76(1) EPC. On page 4 of the Petition, the Petitioner states that the Board did not refer to the Opposition Division's decision in either its communication or decision, and on pages 12 and 13 of the petition, the Petitioner argues that the Board applied the wrong legal standard as regards list shrinking and Article 76(1) EPC. The Enlarged Board considers all these points to be irrelevant as regards the issue of a violation of the right to be heard. In addition, none of these points provides grounds for filing a petition for review as set out in Article 112a EPC.\n\n11. It follows from the above that no violation of the Petitioner's right to be heard can be established regarding its allegations of surprise reasoning in the written decision. Hence, the Petition is clearly unallowable in this respect, so that the Enlarged Board cannot accede to any of the Petitioner's requests.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The petition for review (\"Petition\") concerns appeal proceedings T 2842/18 of the Board of Appeal 3.3.04 (\"the Board\"). The appeal was lodged by the Petitioner against the decision of the opposition division to revoke the patent. The decision of the Board, taken on 1 October 2020 and issued in writing on 19 March 2021, shall be referred to as the \"Decision\". The minutes of the oral proceedings held before the Board on 1 October 2020 shall be referred to as the \"Minutes\".\n\nII. The Petitioner argues that its right to be heard under Article 113(1) EPC has been violated (ground of petition Article 112a(2)(c) EPC). The Petitioner identifies two major aspects of this violation of the right to be heard, the first one will be referred to as \"postponement ? representative argument\", and the second as the \"added matter ? reasoning argument\".\n\nPostponement ? representative argument\n\nIII. The Petitioner made three requests to postpone the oral proceedings in the appeal case, on 2 June 2020, 23 September 2020 and 28 September 2020. The Board granted the first of these requests and rejected the second and third such requests.\n\nIV. The background to these requests was the COVID-19 situation of 2020. As regards its second and third postponement requests, the Petitioner argued that its principal representative during the opposition and appeal proceedings, (hereafter \"SW\"), based in the United Kingdom, had certain personal/national characteristics that made travelling to Munich and attending an in-person oral proceedings on 1 October 2020 inadvisable for him. Points 3.8 to 3.11 of the Petition address this issue.\n\nV. Thus, a consequence of the holding of the 1 October 2020 oral proceedings was that the Petitioner needed to replace SW at short notice with another representative.\n\nVI. The Petitioner sets out what it considers to be violations of Article 113(1) EPC at point 3.3 of its Petition. These points are set out verbatim below:\n\n(i) The refusal to recognize that parties at the EPO have a right to free choice of representation;\n\n(ii) The determination to hold the oral proceedings regardless of the circumstances, both in general and specifically in relation to the appointed representative chosen by the proprietors;\n\n(iii) De facto discrimination based on nationality/residence and personal characteristics of the appointed representative;\n\n(iv) The improper weight given to the acceleration of the proceedings, unfairly to the benefit of the opponents and detriment of the proprietors who were forced to attend oral proceedings without the appointed representative of their choice;\n\n(v) The disregard of the proprietors' right to be heard fully, even with explicit statement that the Board regarded the oral proceedings and hearing of the proprietors as essentially unnecessary for its decision.\n\nVII. The \"Protest Note\" was submitted at the oral proceedings before the Board at approximately 13:05 hours, after the Board had announced its negative opinion on claim 1 of the main request and added matter. This note makes the argument that points i, ii, iii and iv in para VI above constitute a violation of the right to be heard. The Protest Note also contains arguments on the free choice of representation being a constitutional right in Germany, and that similar provisions can be considered to apply in EPC member states and that Article 134(1) EPC is to a similar effect.\n\nThe Added Matter argument\n\nVIII. The Petitioner argues that it was taken by surprise by the Board's reasoning on the non-compliance of claim 1 of the main request with Article 123(2) EPC in the Decision.\n\nIX. From para. 20 of the Board's preliminary opinion, and also from the Minutes, the Petitioner believed that the Board was aiming at illegitimately introducing plausibility considerations into the assessment of disclosure under Article 123(2) EPC. It is now the Petitioner's position (see page 14 of the Petition) that the Board made its decision neither upon the basis of plausibility considerations, nor upon the basis of direct and unambiguous disclosure, but upon the basis of \"certainty\" as a new standard for direct and unambiguous disclosure under Article 123(2) EPC. Such a \"certainty\" standard had never been raised in the proceedings.\n\nX. Since \"certainty\", as the standard to be applied when assessing compliance with Article 123(2) EPC, had not been raised during the proceedings, this reasoning only became apparent once the Decision was issued (see para 4.2.3 of the Petition). Thus, the Petitioner was not able to raise objections under Rule 106 EPC.\n\nXI. At para 4.1.2 of its Petition, the Petitioner argues that it could be considered to have made a de facto Rule 106 EPC objection. It referred to page 5, third paragraph of the Minutes, where it replied to the Chair's question as to whether its right to be heard had been respected with the following comment:\n\n\"The appellants replied that this depended on whether or not they could convince the board that the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC were fulfilled. If not, they indeed considered their right to be heard as being violated.\"\n\nXII. From the Board's preliminary opinion of 27 May 2020, the Petitioner considered that the Board was going to introduce plausibility considerations into the Article 123(2) EPC assessments. The Petitioner disagreed that plausibility considerations had any role to play in such an assessment, and prepared and presented its case accordingly.\n\nXIII. During the oral proceedings, the Chair stated that (see page 4, fourth paragraph of the Minutes) \"? the board had not included considerations of plausibility in the assessment of the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC. The question to be addressed, according to the board, was whether or not there was a direct and unambiguous disclosure for the claimed effect in the application as filed\".\n\nXIV. The Petitioner states that the above statement convinced it that the long established and consistent case law for (literal) disclosure, (see page 14 of the Petition), under Article 123(2) EPC would be applied by the Board and that the Board would not apply any form of plausibility requirement.\n\nXV. It was only once the Petitioner received the written decision that it realised that the Board had based its consideration of Article 123(2) EPC neither upon plausibility, nor upon direct and unambiguous disclosure. This is clear from para. 45 of the Decision (see points 4.1.1 and 4.2.3 of the Petition). From this part of the Decision the Petitioner argues that the Board assessed the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, in the context of second medical use claims, not upon the established standard of literal disclosure of the words basis, but upon the basis of a new standard of its own invention. This new standard was that, even if the claim wording had a literal basis in the application, the application as filed had to provide a disclosure that proved to the skilled person with absolute certainty that the claimed therapeutic effect was definitely achieved. The parties were not heard on this line of reasoning, hence there was a violation of the Petitioner's right to be heard.\n\nXVI. Oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board in a three member composition took place on 28 March 2023. At the end of these oral proceedings the Enlarged Board ordered that the Petition be submitted to the Enlarged Board as composed under Rule 109(2)(b) EPC, (a five member composition), for decision. The parties were summoned to oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board in its five member composition. The oral proceedings took place on 24 November 2023.\n\nXVII. In preparation for the oral proceedings on 24 November 2023, the following substantive submissions were filed by the parties:\n\nOpponent-Respondent VII filed a letter dated 14 June 2023.\n\nOpponent-Respondent VI filed a letter dated 23 June 2023.\n\nThe Petitioner filed a letter dated 4 August 2023.\n\nOpponent-Respondent VI filed a further letter dated 6 September 2023.\n\nOpponent-Respondent VII filed a further letter dated 10 October 2023.\n\nThe Petitioner filed a further letter dated 10 November 2023.\n\nXVIII. The parties provided extensive arguments, in some cases supplemented by further evidence, relating to the issues of this case. In particular, the Respondents argue that the Petitioner did not raise its Rule 106 EPC objection regarding its postponement ? representative argument as early as it should have. The Petitioner reiterated its position as set out in the Petition and its letter of 14 March 2022.\n\nXIX. The parties all made lengthy submissions on the issue of whether the Petitioner was taken by surprise by the Board's reasoning on the compliance of claim 1 of the main request with Article 123(2) EPC. The Petitioner reiterated its position as set out in the Petition and its letter of 14 March 2022.\n\nBoard regarded the oral proceedings and hearing of the proprietors as essentially unnecessary for its decision\n\nXX. This is point v. of the Petitioner's list of violations of its right to be heard, see page 6 of the Petition. The Petitioner withdrew its objection under this head during the oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board on 24 November 2023.\n\nOne-day rather than two-day oral proceedings\n\nXXI. The Board originally summoned the parties to a two-day oral proceeding with its summons of 18 September 2019. This was subsequently changed by the Board to a one-day oral proceedings. The Petitioner withdrew its objection under this head during the oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board on 24 November 2023.\n\nXXII. The Petitioner requests that:\n\n(i) The decision under review is set aside and that the proceedings are re-opened; and\n\n(ii) The members of the Board who participated in the Decision set aside shall be replaced, such that the board of appeal to consider the case on re-opening of appeal proceedings is composed of different members than the composition in the impugned Decision; and\n\n(iii) The fee for the Petition for Review is reimbursed.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\nReview of the Board's discretionary decision to not postpone the oral proceedings\n\n1. The Enlarged Board has no competence under Article 112a EPC to examine the merits of the decision and to go into the substance of a case (R 13/10 para 4, R 7/17 para 7 and 8), not even indirectly (R 3/18 para 2.4, pages 13 - 14). The Enlarged Board not being competent to decide on the merits of a case necessarily implies that the Enlarged Board, as a rule, has no power to control the normal exercise a board makes of its discretion (R 10/09 para 2.2, see also R 6/17 para 3.5). In this case, the Board exercised its discretionary power under Article 15(2) RPBA as regards its decision not to further postpone the oral proceedings.\n\n2. The exercise of discretion is only subject to review if arbitrary or manifestly illegal, (\"... illégalité manifestes ...\", see R 10/11 para 5.2), thereby involving a fundamental violation of the right to be heard (R 9/11).\n\n3. The Petitioner cannot claim that the right to be heard has been infringed in respect of its request that the oral proceedings before the Board be postponed. Whether to postpone the 1 October 2020 oral proceedings was the subject of submissions by the Petitioner and a communication of the Board dated 30 September 2020 setting out the reasons for the Board's rejection of this request. Indeed, the Decision sets out in full detail the various submissions of the parties and the communications of the board on this point, see para XIV to XX, XXIII to XXXV, XLI of the Decision. The Decision substantively considers those submissions in para 5 to 30. Thus, there has been no violation of the Petitioner's right to be heard in this respect.\n\n4. The Enlarged Board thus finds this ground of petition unallowable.\n\nAdded matter reasoning argument\n\n5. The Board's reasoning on added matter is set out at paras. 31 to 57 of the Decision. The wording of claim 1 of the main request was amended to include the therapeutic effect of \"preventing or slowing down the progression in structural joint damage and erosion caused by rheumatoid arthritis\" (hereafter \"the First Feature\"). The issue before the Board was whether there was a disclosure in the application as filed from which it was directly and unambiguously derivable that this was the effect achieved when the treatment was carried out as claimed ? see para. 39 of the Decision.\n\n6. The above objection against the First Feature under Article 123(2) EPC was made by opponent 6, (respondent VI on appeal) on page 14 of its submissions of 8 June 2018 before the opposition division, (where it was directed against auxiliary request 5 filed on 27 April 2018), and on page 7 of its submissions of 19 August 2019 before the Board, (where it was directed against the main request, which had been auxiliary request 14 filed at the oral proceedings before the opposition division). The opposition division found the then auxiliary request 5 not to comply with Article 123(2) EPC for reasons other than those advanced by opponent 6 and found that auxiliary request 14 complied with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.\n\n7. In its communication of 27 May 2020, the Board at points 18 to 28 of the communication took up respondent VI's Article 123(2) EPC objection to the First Feature and pointed out in para 21 that the Proprietor had not responded to this objection.\n\n8. The Petitioner responded to these objections on 31 July 2020. The Petitioner argued that the Board and respondent VI were trying to introduce plausibility requirements into Article 123(2) EPC, plausibility not being a legal requirement of Article 123(2) EPC, but rather being an issue under Articles 83 and 56 EPC. The Petitioner pointed out that Example 3 of the application as filed contained verbatim the First Feature and that Example 1 of the application proved that this technical effect became available (see pages 5 to 8 of Petitioner's submissions of 31 July 2020).\n\n9. At oral proceedings before the Board, whether the First Feature of claim 1 of the main request, (which had been auxiliary request 14 filed at the oral proceedings before the opposition division), complied with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC was discussed with the parties between 09:35 and 12:10 hours. During this discussion, the issue of whether the Board was applying a plausibility requirement to Article 123(2) EPC was discussed. The Board denied that it was applying any such requirement and that the issue to be addressed was \"? whether or not there was a direct and unambiguous disclosure of the claimed effect in the application as filed\" (see last sentence, penultimate para, page 4 of the Minutes).\n\n10. Claim 1 of the main request claims an effect, \"preventing or slowing down the progression in structural joint damage and erosion caused by rheumatoid arthritis\" (that is, the First Feature). These words are found verbatim in Example 3 of the application as filed (see para 43 of the Decision). For the Board, the wording directly before the First Feature in Example 3, \"? [i]t is expected that re-treatment under the protocol herein (or with a different CD20 antibody) will be effective in ?\" meant that the skilled person reading Example 3 would not conclude that the effect of the First Feature was definitely achieved, which is what is being claimed (see paras 43 and 45 of the Decision). Hence, the Board found that claim 1 of the main request did not comply with Article 123(2) EPC.\n\n11. For a decision to comply with Article 113 EPC, the Enlarged Board of Appeal has held that the following three requirements need to be fulfilled, (see R 4/11, point 2.5 and Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 10th edition, section V.B.4.3.8d)):\n\n(i) the party concerned had an adequate opportunity to present its point of view to the board before a decision was taken; and\n\n(ii) the board considered the arguments presented by the party; and\n\n(iii) the decision was based on a line of reasoning that could be said to have been in the proceedings.\n\nIn more recent case law (R 10/18, affirmed in R 6/20), requirement iii. was not mentioned.\n\n12. The main objection of the Petitioner appears to be under (iii) above, that the Board decided the Article 123(2) EPC point upon the basis of \"certainty\", this having never been discussed in the proceedings.\n\n13. The Petitioner arrived at this position from its analysis of para 45 of the Decision. We quote this para of the Decision in full below:\n\n\"The board agrees with the respondents that the statement on page 129, lines 20 to 22 of the application does not amount to an explicit disclosure that retreatment (\"under the protocol ?\") does achieve the effect of \"preventing or slowing down the progression ?\", but rather expresses an expectation of what the outcome of the clinical trial might be. It is the board's view that the skilled person would derive from the passage in question that the above-mentioned effect might or might not be achieved. The skilled person would not conclude that the effect was definitely achieved.\"\n\n14. These considerations led the Board to conclude in para 50 of the Decision:\n\n\"Therefore while the wording \"preventing or slowing down (?) rheumatoid arthritis\" is disclosed in the application, see point 43., the board concludes that the skilled person does not derive from page 129, lines 20 to 22, when read alone or in the context of Example 3 as a whole, a clear and unambiguous disclosure that the therapeutic effect of \"preventing or slowing down the progression in structural joint damage and erosion caused by rheumatoid arthritis\" is achieved when patients with active RA are retreated under the protocol described.\"\n\n15. It thus appears that the Board based its decision on a line of reasoning that had been in the proceedings and thus complied with the requirements mentioned above (in point 11).\n\n16. The Enlarged Board is thus of the view that the Petitioner was able to exercise its right to be heard and that the Decision is not based upon any reasons that the Petitioner had not been afforded an opportunity to comment on. The Petition is thus unallowable on this point as well.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The patent proprietor's petition for review is directed against the decision of Board of Appeal 3.3.02 (hereinafter: the Board) in case T 0041/17 revoking European patent No. 1797038. The petition for review is based on Article 112a(2)(c) EPC.\n\nII. In its decision at point 1.4.3 the Board dealt with the decision T 2114/13 by another board of appeal and concluded that the case at hand was not comparable to that case. In the cited case the closest prior art for assessing inventive step was of a different nature. During oral proceedings before the Board, the patent proprietor had summarized T 2114/13 and had compared it in detail with the case at hand. In its view in both cases the invention disclosed the same technical effect. In the cited case the board of appeal had acknowledged an inventive step based on exactly this effect. While admitting in its decision that the closest prior art in the case at hand was even more remote, the Board denied applicability of the cited case law due to a different effect of the claimed invention without providing any reasons in view of the slurry examples investigating \"solvent mediated conversion\" in the patent. Instead of dealing with the patent proprietor's arguments, the Board misinterpreted its explanations, as is proven by the minutes of the oral proceedings before the Board. This left the petitioner in a situation, where it was impossible to understand how the Board came to its conclusion. Consequently, it was not possible to comment. Even in the event the Enlarged Board of Appeal (hereinafter: the Enlarged Board) could not follow this argument, the petition was well-founded, because it could not be established that the patent proprietor's submissions were indeed considered and fully taken into account. Had the Board correctly applied the case law of the boards of appeal in line with case T 2114/13 an inventive step of the claimed invention should have been acknowledged.\n\nIII. The petitioner's requests are\n\nthat the decision T 0041/17-3.3.02 be set aside;\n\nthat the proceedings before the Board be re-opened;\n\nthat the members of the Board who participated in the decision be replaced; and\n\nthat the fee for the petition of review be reimbursed.\n\nIV. In a communication dated 29 September 2020 the Enlarged Board expressed its preliminary view that the petition was likely to be rejected as being clearly unallowable.\n\nV. In its reply of 23 October 2020, the petitioner addressed the Enlarged Board's preliminary opinion. It pointed out that the Board did not reason as to why decision T 2114/13 was not applicable to the case to be decided although the patent proprietor had pointed at examples in the patent which proved a stability against solvent mediated conversion. Therefore, the decision did not allow any conclusion that this issue had been substantively assessed and found relevant by the Board of Appeal.\n\nVI. At the oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board on 10 December 2020 the petitioner further elaborated on the infringement of the Petitioner's right to be heard. A party to EPO proceedings had a right to a real consideration of its arguments. What was completely missing was an explanation why the Board of Appeal came to a different result when deciding on basically the same facts and evidence as those of case T 2114/13.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\n1. The petition meets the requirements with respect to the time limit and payment of the petition fee.\n\n2. The petition complies with Rule 106 EPC. An objection in respect of the alleged procedural defects had not been possible before the Board as the alleged deficiencies only became apparent with the reasons of the decision.\n\n3. The alleged violation\n\nThe petitioner complains that its arguments concerning the comparability of the cited case T 2114/13 and the case at hand were not considered.\n\n3.1 The law\n\nArticle 113(1) EPC reads:\n\nThe decisions of the European Patent Office may only be based on grounds or evidence on which the parties concerned have had an opportunity to present their comments.\n\n3.2 The interpretation of an opportunity to present comments in the sense of Article 113(1) EPC\n\nAn opportunity to present comments implies that those involved be given an opportunity not only to present comments (on the facts and considerations pertinent to the decision) but also to have those comments considered, that is reviewed, with respect to their relevance for the decision on the matter. On the other hand, the right to be heard does not go so far as to impose a legal obligation on a board to consider each and every argument of the parties in detail in a decision.\n\n3.3 The Board's uncontested facts and arguments\n\nThe Enlarged Board refers to point XI. Inventive step of the impugned decision part \"The respondent's arguments...\" (page 6) referring to the respondent-proprietor's arguments\n\nThe stability to mechanical stress of polymorph I was an unexpected effect in accordance with T 777/08 (headnote 1), T 517/14 (reasons 5.4) and and T 2114/13. The claimed subject-matter involved an inventive step.\n\n3.4 The Board's reasons for the decision\n\nThe Enlarged Board further refers to point 1.4 (page 11):\n\nThis finding is in line with decisions T 777/08 (OJ  EPO 2011, 633), T 517/14 and T 2114/13, cited by the respondent.\n\nand to point 1.4.3 (page 12):\n\nIn decision T 2114/13 (reasons, 5), inventive step was acknowledged on the basis that the closest prior art disclosed a mixture of two polymorphic forms of febuxostat and that the technical problem was the provision of a pharmaceutical composition of febuxostat with improved polymorphic stability, in particular during formulation.\n\nAlso this decision concerns a case that is different from the present one. The effect in case T 2114/13, i.e. polymorphic stability against \"solvent-mediated conversion\" of a slurry in acetone and water (second paragraph of point 5.4 of the reasons) is different from the effect in the present case (stability under mechanical stress) and the closest prior art in case T 2114/13 was a document disclosing a polymorphic mixture while the closest prior art in the present case relates to a compound whose form is not specified.\n\nThis proves that the petitioner's arguments indeed were taken into account. The argument that the Board did not find the patent proprietor's argument correct and deviated from the petitioner's view concerning the choice of the closest prior art and the effect of the claimed invention cannot be heard in review proceedings, because it is a question of the application of substantive law. The assessment of substantive law is excluded in review proceedings, see for example R 3/18, point 2.4.\n\n..., under Article 112a EPC, the Enlarged Board may be called upon by a party to appeal proceedings to remedy a fundamental procedural defect of those proceedings (or in relation to a criminal act) pursuant to Article 112a(2) in conjunction with Rule 104 EPC. [...] The Enlarged Board has no competence under Art. 112a EPC to examine the merits of the decision and to go into the substance of a case..., not even indirectly... A review of the correct application of substantive law would amount to the Enlarged Board being a third instance which has been explicitly excluded... The Enlarged Board cannot act as a third instance or second-tier appellate tribunal in petition proceedings...\n\n4. In the light of the foregoing, the Enlarged Board cannot see a fundamental violation of the petitioner's right to be heard.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The patent proprietor filed a petition for review under Article 112a EPC of decision T 0777/17 of the Technical Board of Appeal 3.3.04 (hereinafter the \"Board\") dated 22 September 2020, which set aside the contested decision of the Opposition Division and revoked European patent No. 2249859, essentially for lack of inventive step.\n\nOverview of the proceedings leading to the petition\n\nII. In the proceedings before the Opposition Division the opposition had been rejected, and subsequently the opponent appealed, arguing insufficient disclosure under Article 100(b) EPC and lack of inventive step under Article 100(a) EPC.\n\nIII. Concerning the written stage of the appeal proceedings before the Board, the following facts are relevant for the petition:\n\n1. During the appeal proceedings the opponent submitted documents D26 and D27 to support their arguments on the lack of inventive step and of sufficiency of disclosure. Documents D17 and D23, which were already in the proceedings, were also mentioned by the opponent in the discussion on the meaning of the variable IU/L in the patent, as part of the sufficiency debate.\n\n2. On 27 July 2020 the Board issued a preliminary opinion in preparation for oral proceedings summoned for 22 September 2020 and stated that the Board expected a revocation of the patent, either for insufficiency of disclosure or lack of inventive step, for all requests. Among other issues, the Board also addressed the possible meaning of the variable IU/L and stated that its precise meaning in the patent was not clear for the skilled person, as an argument on sufficiency.\n\n3. In two letters dated 20 and 21 August 2020, the proprietor requested postponement of the oral proceedings. It was submitted that the proprietor's US counsel would be unable to travel to Germany, due to the Covid situation, and his presence was seen as necessary.\n\n4. The opponent, referring to Article 15(2)(c)(ii) RPBA 2020, argued that the oral proceedings should not be postponed. The Board informed the parties in a communication dated 11 September 2020 that the oral proceedings would not be postponed, referring to Article 15(2)(c)(iv) RPBA 2020.\n\n5. On 15 September 2020 the proprietor requested that the oral proceedings be conducted by videoconference. The request was reasoned as follows: \"We remain of the opinion that the presence of our client, [the US counsel], is essential to our case. As you know, he is in the US and unable to travel to Germany. Thus, we request VICO proceedings in order for [the US counsel] to be able to attend the hearing.\". The opponent agreed to the videoconference on the same day. On 18 September 2020 the professional representative submitted the names of the persons taking part in the oral proceedings in addition to the European representative, including the US counsel. The list of names was accompanied with the following remark: \"For completeness, we note that it was always our intention to attend the in-person hearing with all of the above listed members.\"\n\nIV. The request for holding the oral proceedings by videoconference was granted and the oral proceedings before the Board were held on 22 September 2020 in the form of a videoconference. The persons indicated in advance participated on behalf of the proprietor.\n\nV. According to the minutes, the discussion during the oral proceedings was structured as follows:\n\ni. In a first round, inventive step was discussed for the main request. During the discussion the opponent requested non-admission of an allegedly new argument of the proprietor concerning a direct effect of degarelix on cancer cells. After deliberation the Board gave its finding on the lack of inventive step and that the new argument was not relevant. Its admission was not decided.\n\nii. In a further round, the admission of the auxiliary request 2 was discussed, and the request was admitted. Thereafter inventive step was discussed, and the admission of another new line of argument submitted by the proprietor concerning the role of the haemoglobin level and its link to the hormone refractory stage. After the Board's deliberation the proprietor's new line of argument was not admitted and the request was found to lack an inventive step.\n\niii. After the Board's finding on auxiliary request 2, there was another break on request of the proprietor. After the break, according to the minutes, the proprietor made the following statements: \"they did not want to submit further arguments regarding any of the lower ranking auxiliary requests\" and \"requested the board to record in the minutes of the oral proceedings and in the decision that the respondent had requested that the oral proceedings be postponed, which had however been rejected, and that the rejection had been detrimental to their case.\".\n\niv. The minutes mention that this request was followed by deliberation of the Board, but thereafter the Board did not announce any decision on this request. Instead, the opponent was asked for further comments on the lower-ranking requests, on which they had none. The Chairman invited the parties to state their final requests. The proprietor stated that the claim requests as discussed and presented in the oral proceedings were maintained and repeated the request to record in the minutes the petitioner's statement concerning the rejected postponement, as set out in the previous point.\n\nv. The Chairman asked once more if there were further comments, closed the debate and announced the revocation of the patent.\n\nVI. In the written decision, the Board's reasons correspond to the decisions made at the oral proceedings, both in respect of inventive step and the admission issues. Reasons for not postponing the oral proceedings are also given (points 2 to 4 of the Reasons). There is no mention of the request to record the proprietor's statement in the minutes (see points V. iii. and V. iv. above). The decision mentions documents D26 and D27 as part of the parties' submissions, but they are not mentioned in the reasons.\n\nOverview of the proceedings before the Enlarged Board\n\nVII. The reasoned petition was filed on 7 June 2021, and the prescribed fee was paid on the same day. The petitioner submits that a fundamental violation of Article 113(1) EPC within the meaning of Article 112a(2)(c) EPC and further fundamental procedural defects within the meaning of Article 112a(2)(d) EPC occurred in the appeal proceedings. The petitioner's right to oral proceedings under Article 116(1) EPC was impaired, and the parties before the Board were not equally treated. These petition grounds were based on multiple independent objections, set out in more detail below.\n\nObjection 1: refusal of the Board to postpone the oral proceedings (cf. point III. 4. above) and holding oral proceedings by videoconference against the will of the proprietor (points 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 of the petition). The petition also mentions that the oral proceedings were riddled with various problems, and as a result, the proprietor was unable to present its complete case (point 2.1.4 of the petition).\n\nObjection 2: non-admission of new arguments in respect of the main request (point 2.2.1 of the petition), concerning a direct effect of degarelix on cancer cells (cf. point V. i. above).\n\nObjection 3: non-admission of new arguments in respect of the auxiliary requests 2 (point 2.2.2 of the petition), concerning the link between the haemoglobin level of 130g/l and the hormone-refractory stage of cancer (cf. point V. ii. above).\n\nObjection 4: In contrast to the non-admitted arguments of the patentee, the opponent was permitted to raise new arguments (point 2.2.3 of the petition). The new arguments were based on late-filed documents D26 and D27, and also on D17 and D23, the latter concerning the meaning of IU/L in the patent, as part of the discussion on sufficiency (cf. point III. 1. above).\n\nObjection 5: In contrast to the non-admitted arguments of the patentee, even the Board brought forward new arguments (see point 2.2.4 of the petition). The Board's new argument also concerned the meaning of IU/L in the patent in the discussion on sufficiency (cf. point III. 2. above).\n\nVIII. The Enlarged Board issued a communication under Articles 13 and 14(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Enlarged Board of Appeal (RPEBA) and summoned the petitioner to oral proceedings. The Enlarged Board stated that the petition appeared as clearly inadmissible under Rule 106 EPC and also clearly unallowable in respect of all objections. The petitioner did not submit further observations in writing.\n\nIX. The oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board were held on 30 May 2022.\n\nThe petitioner requested\n\nthat the contested decision be set aside and\n\nthe proceedings re-opened, and\n\nthat the fee for the petition for review be\n\nreimbursed.\n\nThe Enlarged Board issued the decision at the end of the oral proceedings.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\nAdmissibility\n\n1. The petition is reasoned, it was timely filed and the fee was paid (Rule 107(1) and (2) EPC). The petitioner is adversely affected by the decision.\n\nRequirements of Rule 106 EPC\n\n2. Pursuant to Rule 106 EPC, a petition for review based on a petition ground under Article 112a(2)(a) to (d) EPC is only admissible where an objection in respect of the procedural defect was raised during the appeal proceedings and dismissed by the Board of Appeal, except where such objection could not be raised during the appeal proceedings.\n\n3. The file and the submissions of the petitioner do not permit any statement of the petitioner to be recognised as an objection under Rule 106 EPC. This holds true for all five objections. From the minutes, the Board's decision and from the totality of the file it is clear that all those perceived procedural irregularities which now constitute the petitioner's case were known to the petitioner already during the oral proceedings. At no point does the petitioner argue that any of the irregularities only became apparent to it from the written decision. It is also apparent from the minutes that the petitioner had multiple opportunities to formulate a proper objection under Rule 106 EPC already during the oral proceedings.\n\nObjection 1\n\n4. The Enlarged Board indicated in its preliminary opinion that the objections of the petitioner set out in points 2.1.2-4 of the petition are considered to constitute a single objection, based on the statements of the petitioner in point 2.1.5 of the petition. During the oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board this was not contested by the petitioner, who stated that that the core of objection 1 was the rejection of the postponement of the oral proceedings before the Board.\n\n5. As to the requirements of Rule 106 EPC, the petitioner argued in the oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board that it must have been clear to the Board that the proprietor intended to file a petition for review. The petitioner's request for recording its complaint in the minutes could not have meant anything else under the circumstances. An explicit mention of Rule 106 EPC was not required by this rule or any other provision of the EPC.\n\n6. The Enlarged Board acknowledges that the recorded statement in the minutes (see point V. iii. above) is clearly a complaint which expresses the dissatisfaction of the proprietor with the rejection of its request for postponement. However, the Enlarged Board does not accept that the request for recording the complaint or the recorded statement itself is to be considered a formal objection under Rule 106 EPC. The Enlarged Board points to the settled case law of the Enlarged Board of Appeal, namely that an objection under Rule 106 EPC must be expressed by the party in such a form that the Board is able to recognise immediately and without doubt that an objection under Rule 1O6 EPC is intended. An objection under Rule 106 EPC is additional to and distinct from other statements, such as arguing or even protesting against the conduct of the proceedings or against an individual procedural finding. Reference is made to the Case Law of the Boards of Appeal (CLBA), 9th edition 2019, chapter V.B.3.6.2.a).\n\n7. The Enlarged Board recognises that an objection under Rule 106 EPC does not have to make a direct and explicit reference to this rule. As stated in decision R 08/12, Reasons 19, when it comes to determining whether the petitioner has observed Rule 106 EPC, what matters is not the formal wording of the objection but its substance as it could be understood by the Board. On the face of it, the minutes record that there was a request from the proprietor. This request was explicitly directed at the recording of the following statement: \"The respondent had requested that the oral proceedings be postponed, which had however been rejected. The rejection had been detrimental to [the respondent's] case.\" The recording request was apparently granted and the statement was recorded in the minutes, even twice. The recorded statement itself contained nothing that could have demonstrated to the Board that the petitioner in fact meant it as an objection under Rule 106 EPC.\n\n8. The Enlarged Board observes, following the case law, that the purpose of Rule 106 EPC is to give the Board a chance to react immediately and appropriately by either removing the cause of the objection or by dismissing it (R 04/08, Reasons 2.1). By ensuring that errors can be corrected by a Board before a final decision is taken, Rule 106 EPC also ensures that unnecessary petitions for review are avoided (R 18/12, Reasons 19). See also CLBA, supra, chapter V.B.3.6.1.\n\n9. However, from the minutes it transpires that no other requests were formulated at that point from which the Board might have recognised that it was expected either to dismiss an objection or to eliminate the cause of the objection pursuant to Rule 106 EPC.\n\n10. This is also confirmed by the statements of the petitioner made during the oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board. There the petitioner stated in response to a question from the Enlarged Board that at that point in time when the petitioner made its recording request in the oral proceedings before the Board, it would have been too late to request the postponement, as the oral proceedings had effectively finished and the request for postponement and the substantive issues were already discussed and decided on. This demonstrates that at the end of the oral proceedings before the Board the petitioner itself did no longer expect the Board to take any decision that could have corrected the perceived procedural defect. Thus, the Board had no reason to believe that, beyond the recording of the statement, it was also expected to take some corrective action in order to prevent a possible petition for review by the proprietor.\n\n11. It is also clear that the petitioner made no further request for the postponement of the oral proceedings, nor any objection under Rule 106 EPC, when it would still have been possible from the perspective of the petitioner to correct the alleged procedural error, namely at the start of the oral proceedings.\n\n12. The Enlarged Board can even accept that the Board might have suspected under the circumstances that the recording request was made by the proprietor with some purpose, possibly a petition for review of the Board's decision. However, the petitioner could not have expected the Board to enquire about an underlying additional purpose of the request. It is up to a party to formulate its requests, and the explicit request â the recording of a statement â was unambiguous. Even less could the petitioner have expected that the Board would call its attention to the fact that the statement and the request to have it recorded might not be suitable as an objection under Rule 106 EPC. Doing so would have gone against the Board's obligation to remain impartial, and to avoid assisting any party against the other (see also CLBA, supra, chapter V.B.4.3.6).\n\n13. In summary, there was no apparent circumstance that must have led the Board to conclude that the statement of the petitioner and the request to have it recorded in the minutes is nothing else but an objection under Rule 106 EPC, possibly indicating a violation of Article 116 EPC within the meaning of Rule 104 EPC or indicative of a procedural defect under Article 112a(2) EPC in some other way. Even less could it be understood by the Board as an objection relating to Article 113 EPC.\n\nObjections 2-5\n\n14. During the oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board the petitioner maintained these objections, but refrained from providing further comments or arguments on them.\n\n15. In the communication of the Enlarged Board (see point VIII.) it was already pointed out that the petitioner only argued that the admission issues underlying the objections had been timely presented by the petitioner (point 2.2.6 of the petition) but had been incorrectly decided by the Board. There is no statement of the petitioner, either in the file or mentioned in the petition, which the Enlarged Board might possibly identify as an explicit objection under Rule 106 EPC in respect of any of the Objections 2 to 5.\n\n16. Furthermore, the petitioner did not argue that any of the alleged irregularities only became apparent to it from the written decision, as mentioned above in point 3. Indeed, the facts underlying Objections 2, 4 and 5 play no role in the Board's decision, as the corresponding issues did not have to be decided. The non-admission of the argument in respect of the auxiliary request 2 underlying Objection 3 was discussed and decided in the oral proceedings before the Board, and the petitioner had multiple opportunities to make observations after this issue was decided and announced.\n\n17. In conclusion, the Enlarged Board holds that the petition is clearly inadmissible pursuant to Rule 106 EPC in respect of all petition grounds and as such it is clearly inadmissible within the meaning of Rule 109(2)(a) EPC.",

Dennoch sei zu Beginn der Verhandlung der Einspruchsgrund der mangelnden erfinderischen Tätigkeit diskutiert worden. Danach habe eine Zwischenberatung der Beschwerdekammer stattgefunden, und nach\n\nWiedereröffnung der mündlichen Verhandlung sei der Einspruchsgrund der mangelnden Ausführbarkeit erörtert worden.

Das Protokoll weist jedenfalls gegen Ende die Standardformulierung auf:\n\nAuf Frage des Vorsitzenden erklärten die Beteiligten, dass sie keine weiteren Anträge oder Anmerkungen vorzubringen haben.\n\nSodann erklärte der Vorsitzende die sachliche Debatte für beendet und verkündete folgende Entscheidung:\n\nDer Vertreter der Einsprechenden hätte nach  der unterstellten  Mitteilung des Ergebnisses der Beratung zur Ausführbarkeit, spätestens aber auf die Frage des Vorsitzenden am Ende der mündlichen Verhandlung nach weiteren Anträgen oder Anmerkungen gemäß Regel 106 EPÜ rügen müssen, dass in der Verhandlung die Thematik der Neuheit noch nicht behandelt worden sei. Er hätte wissen müssen, dass es sich bei der Mitteilung über das Ergebnis der Beratung zur erfinderischen Tätigkeit nicht um eine abschließende Entscheidung hierzu gehandelt hat.

Sie trat der vorstehend wiedergegebenen Annahme und der Schlussfolgerung der GBK in der Mitteilung entgegen, sie hätte nach  der von der GBK angenommenen  Kundgabe des Ergebnisses der Beratung zur Ausführbarkeit, spätestens aber auf die Frage des Vorsitzenden am Ende der mündlichen Verhandlung nach weiteren Anträgen oder Anmerkungen gemäß Regel 106 EPÜ rügen müssen, dass in der Verhandlung die Thematik der Neuheit noch nicht behandelt worden sei.\n\nDie Annahme und Schlussfolgerung der GBK in deren Mitteilung seien nämlich nicht zutreffend: Die Antragstellerin habe die Erklärung des Vorsitzenden der Beschwerdekammer, dass die sachliche Debatte beendet sei, dahingehend verstanden, dass das lediglich für die sachliche Debatte zur erfinderischen Tätigkeit gelte und die weiterhin offene Behandlung des Themas der Neuheit noch erfolge. Eine Abfrage der Endanträge durch den Vorsitzenden habe nicht stattgefunden. Die Entscheidung sei unmittelbar nach dem Schluss der sachlichen Debatte ohne vorherige Mitteilung ihres Inhalts, d.h. des Ergebnisses der Beratung zu erfinderischer Tätigkeit und Ausführbarkeit, verkündet worden.\n\nDie GBK räumt ein, dass das Protokoll über keine Aussagekraft im Hinblick auf die vorstehenden Behauptungen der Antragstellerin zur Abfrage der Endanträge und Verkündung der Entscheidung ohne vorherige Mitteilung ihres Inhalts verfügt. Sie lässt daher das tatsächliche Vorbringen der Antragstellerin zu deren Gunsten unwidersprochen.\n\nSie teilt aber nicht die Schlussfolgerungen, welche die Antragstellerin hieraus zieht: Nach dem unstreitigen objektiven Verfahrensverlauf hätte die Antragstellerin vor Schluss der Debatte  auch ohne Abfrage der Endanträge  erkennen können und müssen, dass die Kammer nicht beabsichtigte, die Frage der Neuheit noch zu behandeln. Denn die Antragstellerin hat selbst bereits schriftlich (auf Seite 21, zweitletzter Absatz, des Antrags) vorgetragen, dass nach Wiedereröffnung der Verhandlung nach Beratung der Kammer über die Frage der erfinderischen Tätigkeit unmittelbar der Einspruchsgrund der mangelnden Ausführbarkeit diskutiert worden sei und hat das auch während der mündlichen Verhandlung vor der GBK nicht bestritten. Da die Frage der Neuheit und der erfinderischen Tätigkeit eng miteinander verbunden sind, hätte die Antragstellerin ab dem Zeitpunkt der Behandlung des Einspruchsgrunds der mangelnden Ausführbarkeit erkennen können und müssen, dass die Kammer nicht beabsichtigte, die Frage der Neuheit noch zu behandeln. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt hätte sie eine Rüge nach Regel 106 EPÜ erheben können.\n\nDemnach ist der Überprüfungsantrags betreffend den unter Nr. 4a) geltend gemachten Verfahrensmangel der Verletzung des Rechts auf rechtliches Gehört (Artikel 112a (2) c) i.V.m. Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ) mangels Gelegenheit, in der mündlichen Verhandlung vor der Kammer zur Neuheit vorzutragen, wegen Fehlens einer Rüge nach Regel 106 EPÜ unzulässig.\n\nGleiches gilt  aus entsprechenden Gründen  für die in der mündlichen Verhandlung vor der GBK ausdrücklich erstmals geltend gemachten Verfahrensmängel, an welchen die mündliche\n\nVerhandlung vor der Beschwerdekammer gelitten habe, gemäß Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ in Verbindung mit\n\n- Regel 104 b) EPÜ: wegen Übergehens ihres Antrags, zur Neuheit vorzutragen,\n\n- Regel 104 a) EPÜ: wegen Nichtanberaumung einer mündlichen Verhandlung zur geltend gemachten mangelnden Neuheit (unabhängig davon, ob ein derartiger Verfahrensmangel bei erfolgter Rüge rechtlich denkbar wäre).\n\n3. Im Übrigen ist der Antrag auf Überprüfung der verbleibenden geltend gemachten Verfahrensmängel zulässig.\n\n[Es folgt ein Auszug aus der Mitteilung.]\n\nII. Begründetheit\n\n1. Ausgangspunkt\n\nDer Antrag  soweit zulässig  ist begründet, wenn zumindest einer von jeweils mehreren geltend gemachten schweren Verfahrensmängeln\n\n- gemäß Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ, \"insbesondere in Verbindung mit Regel 104b) EPÜ)\", oder\n\n- gemäß Artikel 112a (2) c) EPÜ wegen Verletzung des Rechts auf rechtliches Gehör (Artikel 113 EPÜ) (mit Ausnahme ... [des Mangels] unter Nr. 4a) ... des Überprüfungsantrags)\n\nvorliegt.\n\nDer Überprüfungsantrag der Einsprechenden gibt dazu Anlass, für diesen Antrag relevante Grundprinzipien für das Überprüfungsverfahren, welche die Große Beschwerdekammer (... Hervorhebungen in Fettdruck, auch in Zitaten in dieser Mitteilung, sind solche der GBK) seit Beginn ihrer Rechtsprechung zum Überprüfungsverfahren nach Artikel 112a EPÜ entwickelt hat, in Erinnerung zu rufen.\n\n2. Relevante Grundprinzipien für das Überprüfungsverfahren\n\n2.1 Keine vollständige Überprüfung einer Entscheidung auf deren Vereinbarkeit mit dem EPÜ oder anderem Recht\n\nIn der EPA-Publikation \"Rechtsprechung der Beschwerdekammern\", 10. Auflage 2022 (im Folgenden: \"Rechtsprechung\"), heißt es in Abschnitt V.B.3.4.3:\n\nDer Überprüfungsantrag darf keinesfalls dazu instrumentalisiert werden, die Anwendung des materiellen Rechts überprüfen zu lassen. ... Die Große Beschwerdekammer ist gemäß Art. 112a EPÜ nicht befugt, die Entscheidung in der Sache zu prüfen und im Überprüfungsverfahren inhaltlich auf einen Fall einzugehen ...\n\nDer Zweck des Überprüfungsverfahrens besteht nicht darin zu beurteilen, ob die von der Kammer angegebenen Gründe angemessen sind oder nicht ... ; die Große Beschwerdekammer kann die sachliche Beurteilung einer Kammer nicht durch ihre eigene ersetzen ... Die Große Beschwerdekammer kann im Überprüfungsverfahren nicht als eine dritte Instanz bzw. als ein übergeordnetes Berufungsgericht fungieren ...\n\n2.2 Überprüfung lediglich des Vorhandenseins genau bezeichneter Mängel in Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ\n\nArtikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ bildet keine Generalklausel für Verfahrensmängel, sondern ermächtigt den Gesetzgeber lediglich zur Bestimmung weiterer Mängel in der Ausführungsordnung über die in Artikel 112a EPÜ im Einzelnen bezeichneten Mängel hinaus. Davon sind in Regel 104 EPÜ genau zwei  unter Buchst. a) und b)  abschließend bestimmt worden. ...\n\nIn der \"Rechtsprechung\" heißt es hierzu in Abschnitt V.B.3.4.2:\n\nDie Gründe, auf die ein Überprüfungsantrag gestützt werden kann, hat der Gesetzgeber erschöpfend aufgezählt, nämlich in Art. 112a (2) EPÜ in Verbindung mit R. 104 EPÜ ... Nicht in der Ausführungsordnung genannte Rechtsverletzungen gelten nicht als Verfahrensmängel im Sinne des Art. 112a (2) d) EPÜ (R 16/09) [zu diesen Verfahrensmängeln im Einzelnen siehe Abschnitt V.B.4.4].\n\nDie fehlerhafte Anwendung einer Verfahrensvorschrift, welche selbst nicht zu den im EPÜ aufgezählten Überprüfungsgründen gehört, kann nur überprüft werden, wenn sie einen der in Art. 112a (2) in Verbindung mit R. 104 EPÜ aufgezählten Verfahrensmängel zur Folge hat ...\n\n[Die Nummern der zitierten Entscheidungen der Großen Beschwerdekammer wurden weggelassen.]\n\n[Ende des Auszugs]\n\nDie Antragstellerin widersetzte sich der vorstehend in der \"Rechtsprechung\" wiedergegebenen Entscheidungspraxis.\n\nSie vertrat hierzu die Auffassung, die Qualifikation als \"schwerwiegender Verfahrensmangel\" gemäß Artikel 112a d) EPÜ erfüllten nicht nur die in Regel 104 a) und b) EPÜ genannten Mängel, sondern schwerwiegende Verfahrensmängel seien auch in Verstößen gegen weitere Vorschriften der Verfahrensordnung zu erblicken und dabei namentlich in einem Verstoß gegen Regel 102 g) EPÜ, wonach \"[d]ie Entscheidung [der Beschwerdekammer] enthält: ... g) die Entscheidungsgründe\".\n\nDem kann nicht gefolgt werden. Artikel 112a (2) d) lautet:\n\nAntrag kann nur darauf gestützt werden, dass ...das Beschwerdeverfahren mit einem sonstigen, in der Ausführungsordnung genannten schwerwiegenden Verfahrensmangel behaftet war ...\n\nRegel 104 EPÜ lautet:\n\nWeitere schwerwiegende Verfahrensmängel\n\nEin schwerwiegender Verfahrensmangel nach Artikel 112a Absatz 2 d) kann vorliegen, wenn die Beschwerdekammer\n\na) entgegen Artikel 116 eine vom Antragsteller beantragte mündliche Verhandlung nicht anberaumt hat oder\n\nb) über die Beschwerde entschieden hat, ohne über einen hierfür relevanten Antrag zu entscheiden.\n\nRegel 104 EPÜ nennt ausdrücklich genau zwei Verfahrensmängel nach Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ; weitere Bestimmungen, welche Verfahrensmängel nach dieser Vorschrift ausdrücklich bezeichnen, umfasst die Ausführungsordnung nicht. Die demnach einzige, Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ konkretisierende Vorschrift der Ausführungsordnung lässt keinen Raum für die Zuordnung weiterer Vorschriften der Ausführungsordnung zu diesem Artikel, insbesondere nicht Regel 102 g) EPÜ.\n\nDiese Schlussfolgerung stimmt überein mit der amtlichen Begründung zu Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ (siehe Sonderausgabe Nr. 4, Alb. EPA 2007, Seite 144, Nr. 4., 2. Absatz, Hervorhebung im Original):\n\nArtikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ eröffnet zusätzlich die Möglichkeit, in der Ausführungsordnung weitere schwerwiegende Verfahrensmängel zu nennen, auf die ein Überprüfungsantrag gestützt werden kann. Gemäß der neuen Regel 104 a) und b) EPÜ 2000 kann ein solcher Antrag auch auf schwerwiegende Verfahrensmängel gestützt werden, die dadurch entstehen, dass - eine von einem Beteiligten beantragte mündliche Verhandlung nicht anberaumt wurde - über einen für die Entscheidung der Beschwerdekammer relevanten Antrag nicht entschieden wurde.\n\nWären auch sonstige Verfahrensvorschriften der Ausführungsordnung zum EPÜ unter Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ zu subsumieren, wie die Antragstellerin meint, wäre Regel 104 überflüssig.\n\nDie sprachliche Abweichung zwischen den Bezeichnungen \"sonstig(e)\" und \"weitere\" Verfahrensmängel in den Gesetzestexten:\n\n- \"das Beschwerdeverfahren mit einem sonstigen, in der Ausführungsordnung genannten schwerwiegenden Verfahrensmangel behaftet war\" (Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ) und\n\n- \"weitere schwerwiegende Verfahrensmängel\" (Regel 104 EPÜ) können demnach keinen inhaltlichen Unterschied ausmachen. Das belegen auch die entsprechenden französischen Sprachfassungen, welche die inhaltlich identischen Begriffe\n\n\"autre vice fondamental\" (Article 112bis, paragraphe 2 d) CBE) ,und \"Autres vices fondamentaux\" (Règle 104 CBE) aufweisen. (Die englische Sprachfassung verwendet die Bezeichnungen \"other\" bzw. \"further\").\n\nDie Zuordnung weiterer Verfahrensmängel zu Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ, insbesondere eines Begründungsmangels, kann auch nicht aus der von der Antragstellerin diesbezüglich ebenfalls geltend gemachten Vorschrift des Artikel 125 EPÜ hergeleitet werden. Diese Rechtsnorm lautet:\n\nHeranziehung allgemeiner Grundsätze\n\nSoweit dieses Übereinkommen Vorschriften über das Verfahren nicht enthält, berücksichtigt das Europäische Patentamt die in den Vertragsstaaten im Allgemeinen anerkannten Grundsätze des Verfahrensrechts.\n\nHierunter falle, so die Antragstellerin, die Begründungspflicht von Entscheidungen der Beschwerdekammern, da Begründungsmängel gerichtlicher Entscheidungen nach dem Recht einer größeren Zahl von Vertragsstaaten des EPÜ sanktioniert seien, etwa in Deutschland nach § 100 (3) Nr. 6 Patentgesetz sowie § 547 Nr. 6 Zivilprozessordnung.\n\nNach Auffassung der GBK ist Artikel 125 EPÜ bereits seinem Wortlaut nach nicht anwendbar, da das EPÜ in Artikel 112a und Regel 104 eine Regelung über die Verfahrensmängel enthält, auf die ein Antrag auf Überprüfung von Entscheidungen der Beschwerdekammern gestützt werden kann. Diese Regelung ist ihrem Wortlaut nach abschließend, was durch die amtliche Begründung bestätigt wird. So heißt es dort (ebenda, Nr. 1, Hervorhebung im Original):\n\nUm eine begrenzte gerichtliche Überprüfung von Beschwerdekammerentscheidungen zu ermöglichen, sollte der Großen Beschwerdekammer die Befugnis verliehen werden, über Anträge auf Überprüfung zu entscheiden.\n\nDie Regelung in Artikel 112a und Regel 104 EPÜ ermöglicht auch nach dieser Begründung eine nur begrenzte gerichtliche Überprüfung.\n\nDiese ist vereinbar mit Artikel 6 (1) der europäischen Menschenrechtskonvention (EMRK). Danach ist lediglich eine gerichtliche Instanz für die Überprüfung von Entscheidungen der Verwaltung erforderlich.\n\n(Siehe EGMR, 18. Februar 2009, Andrejewa/Lettland,\n\nCE:ECHR:2009:0218JUD005570700, § 97, unter Hinweis auf Levages Prestations Services v. France, 23. Oktober 1996, § 44, Reports 1996-V, und Annoni di Gussola and Others v. France, nos. 31819/96 and 33293/96, § 54, ECHR 2000-XI).\n\nDas EPÜ, das für die Überprüfung bestimmter Entscheidungen des EPA die Beschwerdekammern vorsieht, geht mit Artikel 112a, welcher auch die Überprüfung deren Entscheidungen unter engen Voraussetzungen ermöglicht, sogar über diese Pflicht hinaus.\n\n[Es folgt ein Auszug aus der Mitteilung.]\n\n2.3 Zum Recht auf rechtliches Gehör\n\nArtikel 113 (1) EPÜ bestimmt: Entscheidungen des Europäischen Patentamts dürfen nur auf Gründe gestützt werden, zu denen die Beteiligten sich äußern konnten.\n\nDie Grundsätze zur Beurteilung des Vorliegens eines Gehörsverstoßes, der sich erst aus der schriftlichen Entscheidung ergeben kann, wurden in der Entscheidung im Fall R 10/18 dargelegt und sind in den Orientierungssätzen zusammengefasst. Diese lauten (in deutscher Übersetzung des englischen Originals durch die GBK):\n\n1. Ein Aspekt des Rechts auf rechtliches Gehör, so wie es von Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ erfasst wird, verlangt, dass eine Kammer das Vorbringen eines Beteiligten erwägt, d.h. die Tatsachen, Beweismittel und Argumente auf ihre Relevanz und Richtigkeit hin überprüft.\n\nArtikel 113 (1) EPÜ ist verletzt, wenn die Kammer Vorbringen, welches aus ihrer Sicht für die Entscheidung relevant ist, nicht in einer Weise behandelt, welche belegt, dass die Beteiligten hinsichtlich dieses Vorbringens gehört wurden, d.h. dass die Kammer dieses Vorbringen in der Sache berücksichtigt hat. (Siehe Entscheidungsgründe, Nr. 2.1.1, welche den maßgeblichen Teil des Orientierungssatzes 1 von R 8/15 bestätigen.)\n\n2. Es wird vermutet, dass eine Kammer das Vorbringen eines Beteiligten berücksichtigt hat, welches sie in den Entscheidungsgründen nicht behandelt hat, d.h. erstens, dass sie es zur Kenntnis genommen und zweitens erwogen hat, d.h. geprüft hat, ob es relevant und ggf. richtig ist.\n\nEine Ausnahme kann bei Anzeichen für das Gegenteil vorliegen, z.B. wenn eine Kammer in den Entscheidungsgründen das Vorbringen eines Beteiligten nicht behandelt, welches objektiv betrachtet entscheidend für den Ausgang eines Falles ist, oder derartiges Vorbringen von der Hand weist, ohne es zuvor auf seine Richtigkeit zu überprüfen. (Siehe Entscheidungsgründe, Nr. 2.1.1.2.)\n\nIn R 8/15 befand die Große Beschwerdekammer, dass Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ enger auszulegen ist als Regel 102 g) EPÜ. Nach dieser Regel muss eine Kammer ihre Entscheidung begründen, ein Verstoß gegen diese Regel ist aber für sich genommen kein Überprüfungsgrund. Die Begründung kann daher zwar unvollständig sein, doch solange sie den Schluss zulässt, dass die Kammer im Laufe des Beschwerdeverfahrens einen bestimmten von ihr für relevant befundenen Punkt sachlich geprüft hat, liegt kein Verstoß gegen Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ vor.\n\nDer Inhalt einer Entscheidung darf die Beteiligten allerdings nicht überraschen. So heißt es unter der Überschrift ,,Verletzung des rechtlichen Gehörs gemäß Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ - überraschende Entscheidungsbegründung\" in der Entscheidung im Fall R 3/15 unter Nr. 4.1:\n\nDer Grundsatz des rechtlichen Gehörs gemäß Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ erfordert es, dass die Entscheidung nur auf Gründe gestützt werden darf, zu denen die Beteiligten sich äußern konnten. Dies bedeutet insbesondere, dass ein Beteiligter nicht durch bisher unbekannte Gründe und Beweismittel in der Entscheidungsbegründung überrascht werden darf ...\n\n[Ende des Auszugs]\n\n3. Anwendung der relevanten Grundprinzipien auf die geltend gemachten Verfahrensmängel\n\n3.1 Verfahrensmängel gemäß Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ, \"insbesondere in Verbindung mit Regel 104b) EPÜ)\"\n\n3.1.1 Grundsätzliches\n\nInsoweit macht die Antragstellerin jeweils einen schwerwiegenden Verfahrensmangel betreffend die Beurteilung der Neuheit (Seite 8 bis Mitte Seite 15) sowie der erfinderischen Tätigkeit (Mitte Seite 15 bis Mitte Seite 20) geltend.\n\nWie oben in Nr. B.II.2.2 festgehalten, hat der Gesetzgeber die Gründe, auf die ein Überprüfungsantrag gestützt werden kann, erschöpfend aufgezählt, nämlich in\n\nArtikel 112a (2) EPÜ in Verbindung mit Regel 104 EPÜ. Nicht in der Ausführungsordnung genannte Rechtsverletzungen gelten nicht als Verfahrensmängel im Sinne des Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ.\n\nDemnach wären Verfahrensmängel nach Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ im Überprüfungsverfahren lediglich dann von Relevanz, wenn ein Mangel nach Regel 104 a) oder 104 b) EPÜ (oder Mängel nach beiden Vorschriften) geltend gemacht würde. Die Antragstellerin hat sich aber im Überprüfungsantrag weder auf das Übergehen eines Antrags auf mündliche Verhandlung (Regel 104 a) EPÜ) noch eines sonstigen relevanten Antrags im Verfahren (Regel 104 b) EPÜ) berufen. Damit sind sämtliche Ausführungen in Teil 3 (Seite 8 bis Mitte von Seite 20) des Antrags zu Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ in Bezug auf diese Vorschrift gegenstandslos.\n\nBezüglich der erstmalig in der mündlichen Verhandlung vor der GBK geltend gemachten Verfahrensmängel nach Regel 104 a) und b) EPÜ wurde oben (im Abschnitt B.I.2.1 a.E.) der Überprüfungsantrag für unzulässig angesehen.\n\nAllerdings hat die Antragstellerin im Rahmen des Verfahrensmangels gemäß Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ auch Darlegungen gemacht, die dem Verfahrensmangel gemäß Artikel 112a (2) c) EPÜ wegen Verletzung des Rechts auf rechtliches Gehör (Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ) zugeordnet werden können.\n\nZu den geltend gemachten Gehörsverstößen hat die Antragstellerin in der mündlichen Verhandlung vor der GBK vorgebracht, die Begründung der Entscheidung betreffend die Prüfung der Neuheit sei unlogisch und widersprüchlich und trage die Entscheidung nicht; Argumente seien gar nicht berücksichtigt oder falsch verknüpft worden. Hierin liege ein Verstoß gegen Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ. Konkret hat die Antragstellerin vier Begründungsmängel (Begründungsdefizite) genannt\n\nund sich dabei auf ihr Vorbringen im Überprüfungsantrag und in ihren Eingaben im Verfahren vor der Beschwerdekammer bezogen.\n\nWas die erfinderische Tätigkeit angeht, so hat die Antragstellerin in der mündlichen Verhandlung vor der GBK auf die mangelnde Gelegenheit zur Stellungnahme bezüglich des Vorwurfs fehlender eigener Vergleichsversuche Bezug genommen.\n\nDie GBK passt ihr Verständnis in der Mitteilung (Nr. 3.1 a.E., Buchst. (a) bis (c)) betreffend die Darlegungen in Rahmen des Verfahrensmangels gemäß Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ, welche Artikel 112a (2) c) i.V.m. Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ zugeordnet werden können, entsprechend an. Die betreffend Neuheit geltend gemachten vier Begründungsmängel werden im folgenden Abschnitt 3.1.2 dargestellt und unter Nr. 3.2.1 auf ihre Stichhaltigkeit überprüft. Die Darstellung des Vorbringens zur erfinderischen Tätigkeit (Vergleichsversuche) und dessen Beurteilung erfolgen einheitlich unten, unter Nr. 3.2.2.\n\n3.1.2 Die vier geltend gemachten, Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ zuordenbaren Begründungsmängel betreffend die Prüfung der Neuheit\n\nIm Einzelnen berief sich die Antragstellerin in der mündlichen Verhandlung vor der GBK auf die folgenden vier schweren Begründungsmängel:\n\na) Überlappungsbereich und ernsthaftes In-Erwägung-Ziehen\n\nIn der Entscheidung sei insbesondere im Abschnitt 3 betreffend die Neuheit das Kriterium der Auswahlerfindung unter Nr. 3.3.4 abgehandelt worden, jedoch der zweite hochrelevante Argumentationsstrang zu Überlappungsbereich (hierzu die Beschwerdeerwiderung vom 25. Juni 2015, Seite 17/18) und ernsthaftem In-Erwägung-Ziehen (hierzu das Schreiben der Antragstellerin vom 17. September 2019 (Erwiderung auf den Ladungsbescheid vom 14. Mai 2019, im Folgenden: Erwiderung) auf Seite 10, Mitte, Seite 12, 3. Absatz, und Seite 14, Mitte) nicht beantwortet worden. Hingegen sei bei der Erörterung der erfinderischen Tätigkeit unter 4.4.1 auf Seite 16 der Entscheidung der Frage nachgegangen worden, ob der Fachmann Arbeiten im Überlappungsbereich ernsthaft in Betracht gezogen hätte.\n\nb) \"Whole content approach\"\n\nDer zweite schwere Begründungsmangel betreffe die Merkmale c) und d) des unabhängigen Anspruchs, d.h. des Verfahrensanspruchs 1.\n\nDie Antragstellerin habe darauf abgestellt, dass der Offenbarungsgehalt des neuheitsschädlichen Dokuments D8a als Ganzes zu betrachten sei und damit der sog. whole-content approach Anwendung finde; siehe Beschwerdeerwiderung vom 25. Juni 2015, auf Seite 14, 2. Absatz, erneut auf Seite 18 und 19; sowie Erwiderung vom 14. Mai 2019 auf Seite 11), auf Seiten 8 und 9 und Seite 11 (Mitte) und nochmals auf Seite 12.\n\nDie Beschwerdekammer habe zwar ihre Kenntnis des \"whole content approach\" zum Ausdruck gebracht. Sie habe aber eine direkte und unmittelbare Offenbarung, die unter die Ansprüche des Patents fiele, verneint, ohne sich mit dem zentralen Argument der Antragstellerin auseinanderzusetzen.\n\nDie GBK bemerkt, dass in der Erwiderung in der Mitte von Seite 11 als dieses zentrale Argument die Notwendigkeit der Korrelierung der für D8a repräsentativen Ausführungsform gemäß Ausführungsbeispiel von D8a mit der allgemeineren Lehre bzw. allgemeineren Offenbarung von D8a bezeichnet wird.\n\nc) Drittes Defizit\n\nDie Annahme der Starttemperatur als einziges Unterscheidungsmerkmal in Nr. 3.1 und 3.4 der Entscheidung sei nicht mit der Annahme in Nr. 3.3.4 vereinbar, wonach keine eindimensionale Auswahl des Temperaturbereichs gegeben sei. Hierin liege eine unlogische Verknüpfung und damit ein Begründungsdefizit.\n\nd) Viertes Defizit\n\nDieser Verfahrensmangel sei auf Seiten 12  14 des Überprüfungsantrags näher behandelt. Daraus ergebe sich, dass sich die Entscheidung betreffend die Starttemperatur auf widersprüchliche Feststellungen stütze, wodurch die Begründungspflicht verletzt werde.\n\n3.1.3 Zusammenfassung der geltend gemachten Begründungsmängel\n\nDie Defizite a) und b) beinhalten lt. Antragstellerin eine mangelnde Berücksichtigung hochrelevanter Argumente, die objektiv nicht in die Entscheidung eingeflossen sind, die Defizite c) und d), dass die Begründung unlogisch und widersprüchlich ist.\n\nDie rechtliche Einordnung dieser Defizite erfolgt in Abschnitt 3.2.1 unten.\n\n3.2 Verfahrensmängel gemäß Artikel 112a (2) c) EPÜ wegen Verletzung des Rechts auf rechtliches Gehör (Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ)\n\n3.2.1 Rechtliche Beurteilung der geltend gemachten Begründungsmängel betreffend die Prüfung der Neuheit\n\nIn diesem Abschnitt werden die oben, in Nr. 3.1.2 dargestellten, in der mündlichen Verhandlung konkretisierten vier Begründungsmängel betreffend die Prüfung der Neuheit auf einen denkbaren Verstoß gegen das Recht auf rechtliches Gehör (Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ) untersucht.\n\n3.2.1.1 Grundsatz\n\nDer Grundsatz der Beurteilung wurde oben (unter B.II.2.3) anhand des Orientierungssatzes von R 10/18 dargestellt. Die GBK stellt diesen wie folgt klar:\n\nArtikel 113 (1) EPÜ verlangt, dass die Kammer Vorbringen eines Beteiligten in der Sache berücksichtigt hat, d.h.\n\n- erstens, dass sie das Vorbringen eines Beteiligten zur Kenntnis genommen und\n\n- zweitens dieses Vorbringen erwogen hat, d.h. geprüft hat, ob es relevant und ggf. richtig ist.\n\nEs wird vermutet, dass eine Kammer das Vorbringen eines Beteiligten in der Sache berücksichtigt hat, welches sie in den Entscheidungsgründen nicht behandelt hat. Denn dann ist anzunehmen, dass es aus ihrer Sicht nicht relevant war.\n\nDiese Vermutung kann widerlegt sein, wenn Anzeichen für eine Nicht-Berücksichtigung vorliegen,\n\nz.B. wenn eine Kammer in den Entscheidungsgründen das Vorbringen eines Beteiligten nicht behandelt, welches objektiv betrachtet entscheidend für den Ausgang des Falles ist, oder derartiges Vorbringen von der Hand weist, ohne es zuvor auf seine Richtigkeit zu überprüfen.\n\n3.2.1.2 Anwendung des Grundsatzes\n\nDefizite a) und b): mangelnde Berücksichtigung hochrelevanter Argumente, die objektiv nicht in die Entscheidung eingeflossen sind\n\n- Kenntnisnahme\n\nBezüglich dieser geltend gemachten Defizite ist zunächst keine Abweichung von der Vermutung der Kenntnisnahme anzunehmen.\n\nBei a) ergibt sich die Kenntnisnahme des Argumentationsstrangs zu Überlappungsbereich und ernsthaftem In-Erwägung-Ziehen durch die von der Antragstellerin selbst vorgetragene Behandlung der Frage in der Entscheidung, ob der Fachmann Arbeiten im Überlappungsbereich ernsthaft in Betracht gezogen hätte, auch wenn diese Behandlung im Rahmen der erfinderischen Tätigkeit und nicht der Neuheit erfolgte.\n\nZu b) hat die Antragstellerin selbst dargelegt, dass die Kammer ihre Kenntnis des \"whole content approach\" zum Ausdruck gebracht, sich dabei aber mit dem in diesem Zusammenhang vorgebrachten zentralen Argument nicht auseinandergesetzt hab. Angesichts der Behandlung dieses Ansatzes in Nr. 3.3.1 und 3.3.2 ist nach der Lebenserfahrung davon auszugehen, dass sie das diesbezügliche Vorbringen insgesamt zur Kenntnis genommen und nicht einzelne Argumente, zumal ein zentrales Argument, gewissermaßen übersehen hat.\n\n- Abwägung\n\nDie Antragstellerin bemängelt demnach offenkundig nicht die mangelnde Kenntnisnahme, sondern vielmehr die fehlende Erwägung hochrelevanter Argumente, d.h. deren Prüfung auf Relevanz und Richtigkeit. Die obige (siehe den vorhergehenden Abschnitt) Vermutungsregel einer Berücksichtigung und damit (nicht nur einer Kenntnisnahme, sondern auch) Erwägung, gelte nicht. Es liege nämlich die Ausnahme vor, dass das fragliche Vorbringen, also das vorgenannte zentrale Argument, objektiv entscheidend für den Ausgang des Falles sei.\n\nDie GBK teilt diese Auffassung nicht. Da das Überprüfungsverfahren nach Artikel 112a EPÜ grundsätzlich nicht der Überprüfung des materiellen Rechts dient, sind Ausnahmen von diesem Grundsatz nur unter strengen Voraussetzungen zuzulassen, was vorliegend bedeutet, dass sich der Charakter des Vorbringens als objektiv betrachtet entscheidend für den Ausgang des Falles aufdrängen muss.\n\nDas war in dem in R 10/18 herangezogenen Urteil des europäischen Gerichtshofs für Menschenrechte (EGMR) der Fall, in dem ein Berufungsgericht die Kündigung eines Pachtvertrages gebilligt hatte, ohne die möglicherweise entgegenstehende, geltend gemachte Verjährung der Berufung auf den Kündigungsgrund zu prüfen. Dieses Urteil ist nachstehend zusammengefasst.\n\nDas Urteil des EGMR im Fall Ruiz Torija v. Spain vom 9. Dezember 1994 (Nr. 18390/91) (im Folgenden auch: Ruiz)\n\nDer Kläger vor dem EGMR war Pächter einer Bar in Madrid. Das zugrunde liegende nationale (spanische) Berufungsverfahren betraf die Kündigung des Pachtvertrags durch den Verpächter und die Räumung der Bar. Der Verpächter behauptete, die Unterhaltungsspielgeräte seien unrechtmäßig in der Bar aufgestellt worden. Der Kläger vor dem EGMR (Pächter) argumentierte, dass die Geräte seit rund 28 Jahren dort aufgestellt gewesen seien und somit die Frist von 15 Jahren ab dem Tag, an dem die Klage hätte erhoben werden können, abgelaufen sei. Ohne diese Frage der Verjährung zu behandeln, entschied das Berufungsgericht zugunsten des Verpächters.\n\nDer Gerichtshof bekräftigte (in Nr. 29), dass Artikel 6 (1) der europäischen Menschenrechtskonvention (EMRK) die Gerichte verpflichte, ihre Urteile zu begründen, aber nicht so verstanden werden könne, dass diese Vorschrift eine detaillierte Antwort auf jedes Argument verlange. Der Umfang, in dem diese Begründungspflicht gelte, könne je nach Art der Entscheidung variieren. Die Umstände des Einzelfalles seien entscheidend. Weiter führte der Gerichtshof (in Nr. 30) aus, dass das Berufungsgericht dieses Vorbringen des Klägers in seinem Urteil hätte behandeln müssen, da die Frage der Verjährung entscheidend gewesen sei. Ohne eine Antwort hierauf sei es unmöglich festzustellen, ob das Berufungsgericht es lediglich vernachlässigt habe, das Vorbringen zu behandeln, oder ob es beabsichtigte, dieses zu verwerfen und was im letzteren Fall die Gründe für eine derartige Entscheidung gewesen wären. Der Gerichtshof erkannte daher auf eine Verletzung von Artikel 6 (1) EMRK .\n\nAnwendung der Grundsätze des Urteils im Fall Ruiz auf den vorliegenden Fall\n\nAus Sicht der GBK hat sich die Behandlung der Frage der Verjährung im Fall Ruiz in den Entscheidungsgründen aufgedrängt, da bei ihrer Bejahung die Berufung offensichtlich zurückzuweisen gewesen wäre. Die beiden vorliegend geltend gemachten Punkte a) und b) sind damit nicht vergleichbar, da die Bewertung der von der Antragstellerin als hochrelevant geltend gemachten Argumente als entscheidend für den Ausgang des Falles eine technische Analyse voraussetzt. Ein entscheidender Charakter dieser Argumente kann sich daher anders als im Fall Ruiz  nicht aufdrängen.\n\nBetreffend die geltend gemachten Begründungsmängel a) und b) gilt daher die Vermutung der Erwägung dieser zur Kenntnis genommenen, aber in der Entscheidung nicht behandelten Punkte und damit ihrer Berücksichtigung. Aus der Nichtbehandlung in der Entscheidung ist abzuleiten, dass die Kammer die von der Antragstellerin als hochrelevant angesehenen Argumente als gar nicht relevant betrachtet und daher auf eine Diskussion in der Entscheidung verzichtet hat.\n\nDefizite c) und d): Begründung unlogisch und widersprüchlich.\n\nEin Begründungsmangel als solcher stellt keinen Gehörsverstoß dar. Wie oben, unter Nr. 2.3, ausgeführt, befand die GBK in R 8/15, dass Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ enger auszulegen ist als Regel 102 g) EPÜ. Nach dieser Regel muss eine Kammer ihre Entscheidung begründen, ein Verstoß gegen diese Regel ist aber für sich genommen kein Überprüfungsgrund. Die Begründung kann daher zwar unvollständig sein, doch solange sie den Schluss zulässt, dass die Kammer im Laufe des Beschwerdeverfahrens einen bestimmten von ihr für relevant befundenen Punkt in der Sache berücksichtigt hat, liegt kein Verstoß gegen Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ vor.\n\nGleiches gilt für unlogische und/oder widersprüchliche Begründungen. Diese können insbesondere materielle Fehlbeurteilungen widerspiegeln, welche im Verfahren nach Artikel 112a EPÜ nicht überprüfbar sind. Strengere Auffassungen, welche in der Rechtsprechung der Kammern vertreten wurden und welche die Antragstellerin zitiert hat, teilt die GBK nicht.\n\nMit ihrer Beanstandung einer unlogischen und widersprüchlichen Begründung betreffend Defizite c) und d) macht die Antragstellerin nicht eine mangelnde, sondern eine fehlerhafte Erwägung ihres Vorbringens geltend. Eine solche ist  wie ausgeführt  einer Überprüfung im vorliegenden Verfahren nicht zugänglich.\n\n3.2.1.3 Ergebnis\n\nAus Sicht der GBK muss ein Gehörsverstoß verneint werden. Aus der zu überprüfenden Entscheidung ergibt sich nach dem Vorstehenden eindeutig, dass die Beschwerdekammer das Vorbringen der Antragstellerin betreffend die vier geltend gemachten Begründungsdefizite berücksichtigt hat, also dass sie es zur Kenntnis genommen und erwogen (d.h. auf Relevanz und ggf. Richtigkeit geprüft) hat (siehe oben, Nr. II.2.3).\n\nMangels der Relevanz einer widersprüchlichen Begründung als solcher für die Beachtung des Rechts auf rechtliches Gehör ist auch das Vorliegen des unter Nr. 4c) des Überprüfungsantrags geltend gemachten Verfahrensmangels der fehlenden \"Gelegenheit zur Stellungnahme bezüglich der widersprüchlichen und somit fehlenden Begründung\" zu verneinen.\n\n[Es folgt ein Auszug aus der Mitteilung.]\n\n3.2[.2] Keine Gelegenheit zur Stellungnahme bezüglich des Vorwurfs fehlender eigener Vergleichsversuche [für die Prüfung der erfinderischen Tätigkeit] (Nr. 4b) [und 3b)] des Überprüfungsantrags)\n\nVorbringen der Antragstellerin\n\nDie Antragstellerin beanstandet, weder im schriftlichen Vorverfahren noch in der mündlichen Verhandlung sei sie jemals \"mit dem Vorwurf seitens der Beschwerdekammer konfrontiert worden, eigene Vergleichsversuche beibringen zu müssen, um den von der Streitpatentinhaberin postulierten technischen Effekt des beanspruchten Starttemperaturbereichs über die gesamte Breite zu widerlegen.\"\n\nErstmals in der Entscheidung sei unter Nr. 4.3.4 der \"Vorwurf\" an die Einsprechende gerichtet worden, dass es ihr freigestanden habe, mittels der Apparatur von Dokument D8a oder einer eigenen Versuchsanordnung darzulegen, eine entsprechende Nitrierreaktion auf den Effekt der Starttemperatur hin zu untersuchen. Aus diesem Grunde sei dann der entsprechende Einwand der Einsprechenden zurückgewiesen worden, obwohl dieser bereits auf Basis des bloßen Dokumentenvergleichs von D8a und Streitpatent dargelegt worden sei.\n\nInsofern liege ein schwerwiegender Verstoß gegen Artikel 113 EPÜ vor, da der Einsprechenden niemals die Gelegenheit gegeben worden sei, zu diesem \"Vorwurf\" Stellung zu nehmen, insbesondere nicht die Gelegenheit, eigene Vergleichsversuche durchzuführen und vorzulegen.\n\nIm Rahmen des geltend gemachten Verfahrensmangels nach Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ erläutert die Antragstellerin (unter Nr. 3.b)(ii), S. 18 unten, des Überprüfungsantrags) näher, warum bereits der Vergleich von Dokument D8a und Streitpatent nachweise, dass das streitpatentgemäße Postulat der Starttemperatur nicht über die gesamte beanspruchte Breite verallgemeinerbar sei. Die Tatsache, dass derartige Vergleichsversuche gar nicht erforderlich gewesen wären, führe, ebenso wie die Tatsache, dass der von der Beschwerdekammer erhobene Vorwurf nicht durchgeführter eigener Vergleichsversuche durch die Einsprechende erstmals im Rahmen der schriftlichen Begründung vorgetragen werde, dazu, dass ein schwerwiegender Verfahrensmangel im Sinne von Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ vorliege. Diese Erläuterungen zieht die GBK für die Prüfung eines Verfahrensmangels nach Artikel 112a (2) c) EPÜ mit heran.\n\nBewertung der GBK\n\nDie Beschwerdekammer vertrat  entgegen der Auffassung der Einspruchsabteilung  die Auffassung, dass der technische Effekt des beanspruchten Starttemperaturbereichs [(Unterscheidungsmerkmal)] über die gesamte Breite dem im Patent gemachten Vergleich zu entnehmen sei; siehe zunächst Nr. 4.3.2 und 4.3.3 der Entscheidung.\n\nUnter der fraglichen Nr. 4.3.4 heißt es dann:\n\nWeiterhin war die Beschwerdegegnerin der Ansicht, der gemessene punktuelle Effekt könne nicht auf alle Arten von Apparaturen verallgemeinert werden. Ein Effekt sei daher nicht über die gesamte Anspruchsbreite nachgewiesen. Es sei ja zumindest offensichtlich, dass im Vergleich zum Ausführungsbeispiel der D8a eine Erhöhung der Starttemperatur die Menge der Nebenprodukte erhöhe, und also keine Verbesserung bringe.\n\nNach Ansicht der Kammer verkennt eine solche Betrachtungsweise jedoch das Wesen von unterscheidenden Merkmalen und Vergleichstests. Durch den gemachten Vergleichstest ist gezeigt, dass eine Erhöhung der Starttemperatur bei sonst gleichen Versuchsbedingungen zu einem erhöhten Umsatz führt. Es ist damit, bis zum Beweis des Gegenteils, glaubhaft, dass dieses Merkmal auch in anderen Apparaturen oder bei anderen geänderten Reaktionsparametern zu einem solchen Effekt führt, solange diese jeweils konstant gehalten werden. Daher ist das unterscheidende Merkmal des Anspruchs in seiner gesamten Breite durch den Vergleichstest gestützt. Es ist nicht verlangt, dass jede beliebige unter den Anspruch fallende Reaktion zu einem höheren Umsatz bei gleichbleibender Menge von Nebenprodukten führt als jede beliebige Reaktion mit niedrigerer Starttemperatur (wie etwa das Ausführungsbeispiel der D8a).\n\nUm zu zeigen, dass der gemessene Effekt nicht über die gesamten Anspruchsbreite eintritt, stand es der Beschwerdegegnerin ja frei, mittels der Apparatur etwa der D8a oder einer eigenen Versuchsanordnung, eine Reaktion, die den weiteren Anspruchsmerkmalen genügt, auf den Effekt der Starttemperatur hin zu untersuchen. Eine bloße Behauptung hingegen kann die Glaubhaftigkeit des von der Beschwerdeführerin gemessenen Effekts nicht erschüttern.\n\nFür die Beschwerdekammer war demnach der im Patent vorgenommene Vergleich glaubhaft. Die Ausführung der Kammer, dass es in diesem Fall der Einsprechenden und Beschwerdeführerin (und Antragstellerin im Überprüfungsverfahren) obliegen hätte, diese Glaubhaftmachung zu erschüttern, entspricht allgemeinen Regeln des Beweisrechts und ist daher nicht zu beanstanden, ebenso wenig wie der von der Kammer erwähnte Beweisantritt durch Vorlage von Vergleichsversuchen. Schon aus diesem Grund musste die Kammer nicht ausdrücklich darauf hinweisen, unabhängig davon, ob ein derartiger Hinweis im inter partes-Verfahren überhaupt zulässig gewesen wäre. Die Entscheidung in Nr. 4.3.4 konnte die Antragstellerin daher objektiv gesehen nicht überraschen.\n\nAbgesehen davon stellt sich die Frage, ob der von der Antragstellerin angenommene Gehörsverstoß sich auf das Ergebnis der zu überprüfenden Entscheidung hätte auswirken können. Denn nach Meinung der Antragstellerin waren Vergleichsversuche überflüssig, da bereits der\n\nVergleich von Dokument D8a und Streitpatent nachweise, dass das streitpatentgemäße Postulat der Starttemperatur nicht über die gesamte beanspruchte Breite verallgemeinerbar sei.\n\nDamit ist auch das ... Vorbringen im Rahmen von Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ der erstmaligen Beanstandung in den Entscheidungsgründen betreffend die Nichtdurchführung von Vergleichsversuchen: (S. 18, 2. voller Absatz, bis S. 19, Ende 1. voller Absatz (vor (iii)) nicht überzeugend.\n\n[Ende des Auszugs.]\n\nIn der mündlichen Verhandlung vertrat die Antragstellerin die Auffassung, die Kammer habe mit ihrem \"Vorwurf\", die Einsprechende (Antragstellerin) hätte Vergleichsversuche vornehmen und deren Ergebnis vorlegen können, die Beweislast umgekehrt. Vielmehr sei die Patentinhaberin zum Nachweis des technischen Effekts des Starttemperaturbereichs über die gesamte Anspruchsbreite verpflichtet gewesen.\n\nWie in der mündlichen Verhandlung von Seiten der GBK  ebenso wie bereits in der Mitteilung (siehe den obigen, dem Zitat von Nr. 4.3.4 folgenden Absatz)  ausgeführt, verkennt diese Auffassung, dass die Kammer den im Patent gemachten Vergleich für glaubhaft  und damit den Beweis des vorgenannten technischen Effekts für erbracht  hielt und es damit der Antragstellerin oblegen hätte, diesen Beweis durch Vergleichsversuche zu erschüttern und den Gegenbeweis zu erbringen. Die Antragstellerin musste damit rechnen, dass die Kammer die Vergleichsversuche im Patent als zutreffend ansehen würde und dass sie diese Einschätzung durch eigene Vergleichsversuche würde widerlegen müssen und die Kammer eine bloße Behauptung betreffend die Versuche im Patent als nicht ausreichend ansehen würde (siehe Nr. 4.3.4 der Entscheidung); erforderlich wäre ein substantiiertes Bestreiten mit Gegenversuchen gewesen. Dass das Thema für die erfinderische Tätigkeit zentral war, ging bereits aus dem Ladungsbescheid vom 14. Mai 2019 hervor (siehe Abschnitt 7.4). In Nr. 7.4.2 bezog sich die Kammer insbesondere auf die Auffassung der Antragstellerin, die Vergleichsdaten im Patent seien nicht glaubwürdig.\n\nAus dem Vorstehenden folgt, dass die Antragstellerin über die von Artikel 113 (1) EPÜ verlangte Gelegenheit verfügte, sich zu dieser Frage mittels Vorlage des Ergebnisses eigener Vergleichsversuche zu äußern. Die Antragstellerin konnte daher durch die Entscheidung der Kammer in diesem Punkt nicht überrascht werden. Der unter diesem Gesichtspunkt geltend gemachte Gehörsverstoß liegt daher nicht vor.\n\n3.3 Ergebnis\n\nNach Alledem erweist sich der Überprüfungsantrag\n\n- gemäß Artikel 112a (2) d) EPÜ, \"insbesondere in Verbindung mit Regel 104b) EPÜ)\", und\n\n- gemäß Artikel 112a (2) c) EPÜ wegen Verletzung des Rechts auf rechtliches Gehör (Artikel 113 EPÜ) (mit Ausnahme der Mängel unter Nr. 4a) und 4c) des Überprüfungsantrags) als offensichtlich unbegründet.\n\nIII. Gesamtergebnis\n\nDie Große Beschwerdekammer verwirft den Überprüfungsantrag gemäß Regel 109 (2) a) EPÜ teilweise als offensichtlich unzulässig, teilweise als offensichtlich unbegründet.\n\nEine Wiederaufnahme des Verfahrens vor den Beschwerdekammern gemäß Artikel 112a (5) Satz 2 und Regel 108 (3), Satz 1, EPÜ kommt nicht in Betracht, da sie nur im Falle eines begründeten Überprüfungsantrags vorgesehen ist. Mangels Wiederaufnahme des Verfahrens ist auch eine Anordnung, dass Mitglieder der Beschwerdekammer, die an der aufgehobenen Entscheidung mitgewirkt haben, zu ersetzen sind, nicht möglich.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The petition for review concerns decision T 574/19 dated 18 January 2022 by which Technical Board of Appeal 3.3.07 (the board) set aside the contested decision rejecting the oppositions and remitted the case to the opposition division with the order to maintain the patent in amended form on the basis of the claims of auxiliary request III.\n\nII. The petition for review submitted by appellant-opponent 1 (the petitioner) is based on Article 112a(2)(c) EPC, i.e. that a fundamental violation of the petitioner's right to be heard under Article 113(1) EPC occurred. The petition was duly filed, and the required fee was paid.\n\nIII. In the decision under review, the board concluded that while the subject-matter claimed in the main request and auxiliary requests I and II did not involve an inventive step, the claims of auxiliary request III were allowable. In relation to inventive step of the subject-matter claimed in auxiliary request III, the board accepted that the feature of the average particle size of the main excipient as defined in claim 1, which, inter alia, distinguished the subject-matter of claim 1 from the solvent-free method disclosed in document D1, was associated with the issue of stickiness of the mixture. On the basis of considerations on this technical effect, the objective technical problem was formulated, and the board concluded that the claimed solution was not obvious.\n\nIV. The petitioner is of the view that the board, in its reasoning for acknowledging an inventive step of the subject-matter claimed in auxiliary request III, did not consider the submissions presented by the petitioner in the letter dated 22 November 2021 and that it was likely that the claims of auxiliary request III would not have been found allowable had these submissions been taken into account. With this second assertion, the petitioner implies that the violation of Article 113(1) EPC was fundamental within the meaning of Article 112a(2) EPC as it could not be excluded that the board would otherwise have come to a different conclusion.\n\nThe arguments which the petitioner contended were not taken into account by the board despite being relevant and essential are the petitioner's submissions on page 3, third paragraph to page 6, third paragraph of the letter dated 22 November 2021 (see petition for review, page 7, first paragraph).\n\nV. As regards the proceedings before the board, the following can be noted.\n\n(a)  The points in dispute between the parties included, inter alia:\n\n- which starting point was to be used in the assessment of inventive step\n\n- how the objective technical problem should be formulated under the problem-solution approach\n\n(b) In the decision under appeal, the opposition division had assessed inventive step starting from either of two methods disclosed in document D1, wet granulation and dry granulation, and concluded that the subject-matter claimed in the patent involved an inventive step starting from either of the two methods.\n\n(c) On appeal, the petitioner submitted in the statement of grounds of appeal that, in fact, the (dry/solvent-free) direct compression method should be taken as the closest prior art, not the wet granulation method. The petitioner, contesting the opposition division's formulation of the objective technical problem when starting from the direct compression method, presented its view on the formulation of the problem and presented arguments on obviousness.\n\n(d) In the proceedings before the opposition division and again during the appeal proceedings, the patent proprietor contested that the dry granulation/direct compression method could be taken as a starting point for assessing inventive step and argued that the wet granulation method should be chosen in document D1 as the single starting point for the assessment. However, the patent proprietor did assert lines of defence for the presence of an inventive step for both alternative starting points and submitted sets of claims of auxiliary requests I to VII. In relation to auxiliary request III, the patent proprietor submitted that \"[m]ain excipient particle size advantageously contributes to overcoming the problems caused by the strong aggregation properties of solifenacin salts leading to poor content uniformity and sticking of the mixture to the punches during compression, as well as contributes to an advantageous bioavailability\" (reply to appeals, item V.3.).\n\n(e) In a subsequent letter, the petitioner rebutted the patent proprietor's arguments on the starting point for assessing inventive step, reiterated its position on the formulation of the objective technical problem and presented counter-arguments against the patent proprietor's submissions on inventive step starting from wet granulation. In relation to auxiliary request III, the petitioner submitted that given the absence of a relevant comparison, it could not be derived from the patent whether the particle size distribution of the main excipient as claimed was indeed the decisive parameter which solved the problem of poor content uniformity (which was inherent to the direct compression method) for solifenacin succinate.\n\n(f) In preparation for the oral proceedings, the board stated the following on inventive step in point 2.3.1 in the communication under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020:\n\n\"(a) Starting from the solvent-free methods of Dl\n\nAs pointed out by the respondent, Dl only exemplifies the wet granulation method, and contains no actual example of any solvent free method. Dl further expresses a clear preference for the wet granulation [...] Nonetheless, the opposition division found that the solvent-free method of Dl qualified as a suitable starting point for the assessment of inventive step, because it is was [sic] clearly and unambiguously disclosed in Dl, and Dl in general addressed the problem of stability. This point will be debated during the oral proceedings.\"\n\nIn the subsequent passage, the board identified the differences between the solvent-free direct compression method of document D1 and the process of claim 1 of the main request and indicated that it was inclined to formulate the objective technical problem as the opposition division had done. It continued by stating:\n\n\"It will be debated whether the problem may be formulated as the provision of appropriate excipients for the preparation of a crystalline solifenacin (salt)-containing solid formulation using direct compression, as submitted by appellant 1. The Board however emphasizes that the statement of the problem should not contain pointers to the solution as this would result in an ex post facto assessment of inventive step. The Board preliminarily notes that appellant l's statement of the problem appears to [...]\"\n\nThe board subsequently provided comments on obviousness, noting that this point would be discussed at the oral proceedings, as it did on inventive step when starting from other starting points. Under point 3 of the communication, the board stated the following about the auxiliary requests:\n\n\"In the event that the main request is found to be not allowable, the auxiliary requests will be considered.\n\nIn particular, with respect to inventive step for auxiliary requests III, IV, V, VIII and IX, it may be discussed whether the particle size distributions of the main excipient defined therein credibly lead to improvements with respect to bioavailability, content uniformity and sticking of the mixture to the punches during compression.\"\n\n(g) The petitioner, in its letter dated 22 November 2021, replied to the board's communication. In point 1, the petitioner stated its requests and under the heading \"2. Fehlende erfinderische Tätigkeit\" (lack of inventive step), the petitioner referred to two issues mentioned by the board as issues for discussion at the oral proceedings, namely:\n\n- whether the solvent-free direct compression method of document D1 could form the starting point for assessing the inventive step of the subject-matter claimed in the main request\n\n- how the objective technical problem should be formulated\n\nUnder point 2.1 headed \"Direktverpressung als Ausgangspunkt in der Bewertung der erfinderischen Tätigkeit\" (direct compression as the starting point in the assessment of inventive step), the petitioner explained why, in its opinion, the solvent-free direct compression method of document D1 should be considered the starting point for assessing inventive step.\n\nThe petitioner reiterated its previous submissions that the skilled person would not have been deterred from carrying out the direct compression method because of stability considerations and that the skilled person would have known how to resolve any drawbacks associated with the direct compression method (letter dated 22 November 2021, page 2, last paragraph to page 3, last full paragraph).\n\nThe petitioner then presented further submissions with considerations on the low drug concentration in the tablets of document D1 and the examples of the patent (letter dated 22 November 2021, starting on page 3, last paragraph). On the basis of these further submissions, the petitioner concluded that, inter alia, the skilled person would have assumed that the issue of sticking would not occur for tablets with a low drug concentration (letter dated 22 November 2021, page 4, fourth paragraph) and that the skilled person would generally have preferred the direct compression method to prepare the tablets described in document D1, which contained solifenacin (salt) only in a low concentration (page 5, penultimate paragraph of the letter).\n\nIn the next passage in the letter (page 5, final paragraph to page 6, paragraphs before point 2.2), the petitioner summarised the arguments mentioned previously in its submissions and concluded that the skilled person would indeed have considered preparing tablets containing solifenacin (salt) by direct compression.\n\nIn subsequent point 2.2 of the letter dated 22 November 2021, headed \"Formulierung der objektiven technischen Aufgabe\" (formulation of the objective technical problem), the petitioner reiterated its position on how the objective technical problem should be formulated when starting from the direct compression method of D1.\n\nThis letter did not address any other point indicated for discussion at the oral proceedings in the board's communication under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020.\n\n(h) At the oral proceedings before the board, after a discussion of inventive step of the main request and the board's announcement of its negative conclusion, the auxiliary requests were discussed, including a discussion of inventive step for auxiliary request III (minutes of the oral proceedings, passage bridging pages 2 and 3).\n\nVI. The Enlarged Board of Appeal (Enlarged Board) in its composition pursuant to Rule 109(2)(a) EPC, summoned the petitioner to oral proceedings as requested and issued a communication pursuant to Article 13 and Article 14(2) RPEBA in preparation for the oral proceedings.\n\nVII. By the date set in the Enlarged Board's communication, the petitioner had made further written submissions on the merits of the review case.\n\nVIII. Oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board took place on 19 April 2023.\n\nThe petitioner requested that decision T 574/19 be set aside and that the proceedings before the board be re-opened.\n\nBefore the oral proceedings were closed, the present decision was announced.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\nAdmissibility of the petition for review\n\n1. The requirements under Article 112a(1) and (4) EPC in conjunction with Rule 107 EPC have been met.\n\n2. Pursuant to Rule 106 EPC, a petition under Article 112a(2)(c) EPC, like the one in hand, is only admissible where an objection in respect of the procedural defect was raised during the appeal proceedings and dismissed by the board, except where such objection could not be raised during the appeal proceedings.\n\n3. The petitioner submitted that it could not have raised an objection to a procedural defect on which the petition was based during the appeal proceedings since it could not know that its submissions in the letter dated 22 November 2021 would not be taken into account by the board in the inventive-step assessment.\n\n4. The Enlarged Board accepts that the asserted procedural defect became apparent for the petitioner after having received the written reasoned decision and that, therefore, the petitioner could not have raised an objection during the appeal proceedings.\n\n5. The petition for review is thus not to be considered as clearly inadmissible.\n\nAllowability of the petition for review\n\n6. The Enlarged Board holds that the petition for review is clearly unallowable. No violation of Article 113(1) EPC as submitted by the petitioner has occurred, let alone a fundamental one.\n\n7. Under Article 113(1) EPC, decisions may only be based on grounds or evidence on which the parties concerned have had an opportunity to present their comments. This implies not only that a party be given the opportunity to present its views but also that its relevant submissions be taken into account and considered.\n\n8. A board ignoring essential and relevant submissions presented by a party may amount to a fundamental violation of the party's right to be heard within the meaning of Article 112a(2)(c) EPC, as correctly indicated by the petitioner with reference to R 8/17, Reasons 25, in which the Enlarged Board held: \"According to the established case law, Article 113(1) EPC may be infringed if the reasons for a decision fail to take into account a party's essential and relevant arguments. The right to be heard also requires that those involved be given an opportunity not only to present comments but also to have those comments considered, i.e. reviewed as to their relevance for the decision in the matter (see R 23/10 of 15 July 2011, reasons 2; R 19/12 of 12 April 2016, reasons 6 to 6.3). The boards have an obligation to discuss in their decisions issues and arguments to the extent that they are relevant for the decision. On the other hand, they may disregard irrelevant arguments, and the refutation of arguments may be implicitly inferred from the particular reasoning. Accordingly, the boards' obligation to consider a party's argumentation is shaped by the circumstances of each case.\"\n\n9. However, the Enlarged Board does not find that the petitioner's right to be heard was violated in the circumstances of the case in hand.\n\n10. For the claims of auxiliary request III considered allowable by the board, including the issue of inventive step, the petitioner had been given the opportunity to present its comments in written procedure and at the oral proceedings. This was not contested.\n\n11. The petitioner submitted at the oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board that it had been surprised by the reasoning in the decision under review in that the two effects of content uniformity and stickiness of the tabletting mass were considered separately in the assessment of inventive step.\n\n12. This can, however, only be considered a subjective surprise which cannot change the fact that the petitioner knew the issues which might be raised and had adequate opportunity to comment on them. In point 3 of the communication under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020, the board had highlighted that \"whether the particle size distributions of the main excipient defined therein credibly lead to improvements with respect to bioavailability, content uniformity and sticking of the mixture to the punches during compression\" might be discussed at the oral proceedings for the auxiliary requests, auxiliary request III explicitly included.\n\nThe Enlarged Board cannot derive anything from that communication or the minutes of the oral proceedings before the board which would have prevented the parties from presenting their points of view on the effects which they consider associated or not with the distinguishing feature of the particle size distribution. Nor can it see anything which would have suggested that each of these technical effects, asserted by the patent proprietor (see section V.(d) above), might not be considered on its own.\n\n13. With regard to the petitioner's complaint that the board ignored essential and relevant submissions contained in the letter dated 22 November 2021, the Enlarged Board finds no violation of Article 113(1) EPC, contrary to the petitioner's view.\n\n14. The Enlarged Board cannot establish that:\n\n- the argument as suggested by the petitioner in the petition for review can be derived from these submissions\n\n- the submissions relied upon should be considered relevant and essential arguments for establishing the technical effects associated with the differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request III and the solvent-free method of document D1 as the closest prior art\n\n- the submissions were ignored by the board\n\n15. According to the petitioner, it had been argued in the passage on page 3, third paragraph to page 6, third paragraph of the letter that there was a causal link between the solifenacin succinate's concentration in the tabletting mass (and not the particle size of the main excipients as decided by the board) and the reduction of the stickiness of the tabletting mass, i.e. that it was the low drug concentration which caused the effect of reducing the stickiness of the tabletting mass, while the effect would not be achieved for high drug concentrations (see petition for review, page 10, fourth paragraph; page 11, fourth paragraph, final sentence and page 12, first paragraph).\n\n16. However, the passage relied upon by the petitioner does not contain a statement or argument addressing the presence or absence of technical effects associated with the technical feature of the particle size distribution which distinguished the subject-matter claimed in auxiliary request III from the direct compression method disclosed in document D1. Nor does the passage contain a statement or argument that the effect on the mixture's stickiness would not be achieved when preparing tablets with high drug concentrations.\n\nThe absence of such a statement or argument was also acknowledged by the petitioner in its letter dated 9 February 2023 (see paragraphs bridging pages 6 and 7) and, for the feature of the particle size distribution, not disputed at the oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board.\n\n17. The Enlarged Board further notes that the petitioner had presented the submissions of the letter dated 22 November 2021, which were allegedly not considered by the board, in a specific context, namely to convince the board of how the two issues to be discussed at the oral proceedings mentioned under the heading lack of inventive step (see section V.(g) above) should be resolved, i.e. that:\n\n- the dry solvent-free direct compression method should be taken as the starting point for assessing inventive step\n\n- the objective technical problem should be formulated as suggested by the petitioner\n\n18. The contents of the passage on inventive step were indeed exclusively dedicated to these two issues of the direct compression method as the starting point for the assessment of inventive step and the formulation of the objective technical problem, respectively.\n\n19. In point 2.1 of the letter dated 22 November 2021 on the determination of the starting point for assessing inventive step, hence the first step of the problem-solution approach, the petitioner relied on several aspects, including drug concentration, to support its position. Considerations on the drug concentration were not presented for other aspects of the problem-solution approach, let alone for the claims of auxiliary request III and its distinguishing features.\n\n20. Drug concentration was relied upon by the petitioner in its line of argument that a sticking of the tabletting mass to the punches due to the solifenacin salt's property to aggregate had not to be expected for low-dose tablets. Thus, because the tablets of D1 were - like the tablets in the patent - low-dose tablets, since the skilled person would have known how to overcome any drawbacks of direct compression and in view of a general preference for the direct compression method due to stability considerations, the direct compression method of D1 should form the starting point for assessing inventive step.\n\n21. None of the other matters indicated by the board in its communication under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020 as points for discussion at the oral proceedings, including the technical effects associated with the feature of the particle size distribution as contained in the claims of the auxiliary requests, was addressed in the letter dated 22 November 2021.\n\n22. As derivable from the decision under review, the board considered the issue of the starting point for the assessment of inventive step of the subject-matter claimed in the main request, provided reasons why it considered inventive step starting from both the wet granulation method and the solvent-free direct compression method of D1, and explicitly dealt with arguments presented by the patent proprietor that the solvent-free method of D1 could not form the starting point (decision under review, point 2.2 of the Reasons with sub-points on pages 12 to 15).\n\n23. At the oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board, the petitioner confirmed that it did not claim that the board, having agreed with the petitioner that the solvent-free direct compression method was a starting point in the assessment of inventive step, had to address the petitioner's submissions made under point 2.1 of the letter dated 22 November 2021 (i.e. including the passage on which the petitioner relied in its petition for review) in its reasoning on the determination of the starting point for assessing inventive step.\n\n24. The petitioner, however, was of the view that the submissions on drug concentration, albeit made for determining the starting point for assessing inventive step, should have been considered by the board also in any further context in which these submissions become relevant for the board's decision, without the petitioner having to repeat or refer to them in these other possible contexts. And since the petitioner had addressed the issue of stickiness in the selection of the starting point, there had been no need for the petitioner to address the issue in another stage of the problem-solution approach, e.g. when formulating the objective technical problem.\n\nThe board's obligation to address these submissions whenever they became relevant was due to the fact that the petitioner, when making the submissions, had not known the board's reasoning. While it was not put into question that the board need not give its reasoning before delivering its decision, the consequence of this was that the board had to address all submissions presented whenever they became relevant in the board's reasoning (\"[p]arties must expect that their arguments will be put by the Board of Appeal in that context it considered it most appropriate when rendering its decision\", letter dated 9 February 2023, page 8, point 2).\n\nWhile it was admitted that the argument had not been made in the petitioner's submissions dated 22 November 2021 (see point 16 above), \"it should have been obvious to the Board of Appeal that a high-dose tablet would not solve the objective technical problem as formulated by the Board\" (letter dated 9 February 2023, paragraph bridging pages 4 and 5).\n\n25. The Enlarged Board notes that the petitioner is complaining that the board did not consider (and address in the reasoning of its decision) arguments which the petitioner did not actually make. In other words, according to the petitioner, the board should have taken the petitioner's submissions presented in a relevant context (the aspect of low drug concentration presented by the petitioner in its line of argument on the determination of the starting point for assessing inventive step) also into account in a different context (technical effect associated with the distinguishing feature of the particle size distribution and formulation of the objective technical problem) and further elaborate on those submissions by adding anything that would be missing if they had been presented in that other context and address those further elaborated submissions in that other context.\n\n26. It is, however, the petitioner and its representative that were responsible for the conduct of the petitioner's case, and it was for them to submit the necessary arguments to support the petitioner's case. It was not the board's task to make the argument for the petitioner by taking the petitioner's submission out of the relevant context in which it had been presented and by elaborating on the submissions on the basis of what would be obvious and beneficial for the petitioner to argue. To the contrary, a board must be impartial and retain neutrality towards the parties involved in the proceedings and, hence, cannot make the case for a party.\n\n27. The petitioner stated at the oral proceedings that it was not uncommon for a board to address a party's argument, albeit presented in a different context, if the argument was relevant for the board's decision.\n\n28. However, the case at hand is not about addressing a presented argument but about addressing an argument which had not actually been made and about whether the asserted non-consideration of such an argument represents a fundamental violation of Article 113(1) EPC.\n\n29. The petitioner also referred to the fact \"that the petitioner succeeded in the appeal with respect to the main request\" and, \"[a]ccordingly, the petitioner could expect that its line of argumentation as submitted with letter dated 22 November 2021 was successful\" (letter dated 9 February 2023, page 8, point 1).\n\n30. The Enlarged Board can understand that the board's announcement at the oral proceedings that the subject-matter claimed in the main request was considered not to involve an inventive step may have raised the petitioner's expectation that the board had considered its argument convincing.\n\n31. Objectively, however, the Enlarged Board cannot derive such an expectation from the circumstances at the time the letter dated 22 November 2021 was drafted or at the oral proceedings when the board announced its conclusion of lack of inventive step for the main request.\n\n32. The proceedings in appeal case T 574/19 were inter partes proceedings involving three active parties including two appellant-opponents, the petitioner being one of them. In fact, the other appellant-opponent had advanced an objective technical problem different from that of the petitioner in its objection of lack of inventive step against the main request (see appellant-opponent 2's statement of grounds of appeal, point 6.5.2.2 and decision under review, section XII.(b)). Hence, a parallel but different line of argument existed which could also have been the cause of the appellants' success in respect of the main request.\n\n33. Furthermore, the board, in its communication under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020, had stated that it was \"inclined to formulate the problem as the opposition division did\" and had provided an explanation why it did not agree with the problem set out by the petitioner in its statement of grounds of appeal (see communication under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020, page 11, second paragraph: \"problem should not contain pointers to the solution as this would result in an ex post facto assessment of inventive step\" and \"appellant 1's statement of the problem appears to anticipate that the differentiating feature lies with the excipients\"). While the petitioner in its later letter dated 22 November 2021 on the objective technical problem reiterated its position and presented counter-arguments to the board's considerations, the possibilities remained that the board would still not accept the petitioner's line of argument and that a finding of lack of inventive step by the board, although desired by the petitioner, would be based on a line of argument presented by a different party. Bearing these possibilities in mind, the petitioner could have presented subsidiary lines of argument for if the board did not accept the petitioner's main line of argument.\n\n34. At the oral proceedings before the Enlarged Board, the petitioner further submitted that the letter dated 22 November 2021 as a whole had not been taken into account and considered by the board. While it was not contested that the letter had been received, as is clear from section X. of the decision under review, the board ignored the whole content as the board nowhere addressed the points made in that letter, including those made on the formulation of the objective technical problem presented in point 2.2.\n\n35. The Enlarged Board, however, does not agree. In the first paragraph of point 2.2 of the letter dated 22 November 2021, the petitioner replied to the board's envisaged formulation of the objective technical problem as indicated in the board's communication under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020. The petitioner submitted that when starting the assessment of inventive step from the direct compression method, the objective technical problem could not be an \"alternative\" process because the sets of claims of all claim requests related to the preparation of a tablet using direct compression. In the decision under review, point 2.4 of the Reasons, the board addressed this further submission and explained that, \"[c]ontrary to appellant 1's opinion, formulating the problem as the provision of an alternative to the solvent-free process of D1 does not mean that the solution cannot be a solvent-free process, defined by further features\".\n\nIn the second paragraph of point 2.2 of the letter dated 22 November 2021, the petitioner maintained that its formulation of the objective technical problem was not based on hindsight and stated that an ex post facto assessment would be present only if the problem as formulated suggested that the solution to the problem lay in the choice of the three specific excipients as claimed. The board, however, remained of the view that \"[s]uch a formulation [as suggested by the petitioner] anticipates that the differentiating feature lies with the excipients, and thus contains a pointer to the solution\" (decision under review, point 2.4 of the Reasons).\n\nRegarding the submissions presented under point 2.1 of the letter, the Enlarged Board, for the considerations set out above, cannot establish that the board, by not having addressed them in the decision under review, violated the petitioner's right to be heard.\n\n36. The Enlarged Board thus concludes that the petitioner had the opportunity to present its comments on inventive step of the subject-matter claimed in auxiliary request III, including on the technical effect(s) associated with the features distinguishing the claimed subject-matter from the solvent-free direct compression method of D1, the formulation of the objective technical problem and obviousness. The argument on which the current petition for review was based had not actually been made, let alone against auxiliary request III.\n\n37. The petitioner considering the board's finding on the presence of an inventive step incorrect on substance is a matter which cannot be assessed by the Enlarged Board, as acknowledged by the petitioner at the oral proceedings. A petition for review can only be based on the limited number of grounds exhaustively set out in Article 112a(2) and Rule 104 EPC, and a review of the decision taken by the board as to its merits is not among them.\n\n38. As the Enlarged Board does not find any violation of Article 113(1) EPC as suggested by the petitioner, let alone a fundamental one, the petitioner's request for the setting aside of the decision under review and the reopening of the proceedings before the board cannot be granted.",

         "Summary of Facts and Submissions\n\nI. The appeals by opponents 1 to 3 (\"appellants 1 to 3\") lie from the decision of the opposition division to reject the oppositions against European patent No. 2 670 401 (\"the patent\").\n\nII. The patent contains 9 claims, independent claims 1 and 9 of which read as follows:\n\n\"1. A compound of Formula (I)\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;\n\nwherein [...];\n\nfor use in a method of treating an EML4-ALK**(+) non-small cell lung cancer, and optionally resistant to crizotinib.\"\n\n\"9.

In their statements of grounds of appeal, the appellants maintained that the claimed subject-matter lacked an inventive step in view of either D1 or D2 taken as the closest prior art.\n\nAppellant 2 corroborated its arguments by filing the following new item of evidence:\n\nD29:  Annex III - Activity Data filed by the respondent with the EPO on 9 June 2011 during the examination proceedings relating to document D1.\n\nV. In its reply to the statements of grounds of appeal, the patentee (\"respondent\") rebutted the arguments of the appellants and argued, inter alia, that the claimed subject-matter involved an inventive step in view of either D1 or D2 taken as the closest prior art.\n\nVI. The parties were summoned to oral proceedings in accordance with their requests.\n\nVII. In preparation for the oral proceedings, the board issued a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA 2020.\n\nVIII. In a subsequent letter, the respondent replied to the board's communication and submitted further arguments in favour of the inventive step of the claimed subject-matter.\n\nIX. In a further communication the board informed the parties that, in view of the coronavirus pandemic, the oral proceedings would be held by videoconference.\n\nX. By letters dated 6 September 2021, 24 August 2021 and 27 September 2021, respectively, appellants 1, 2 and 3 informed the board that they would not be attending the oral proceedings.\n\nXI. Oral proceedings before the board were held on 28 September 2021 by videoconference in the absence of appellants 1 to 3.\n\nXII. Final requests\n\nThe appellants requested in writing that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be revoked.\n\nThe respondent requested that the appeals be dismissed (main request), implying maintenance of the patent as granted. Alternatively, it requested that the patent be maintained in amended form on the basis of the claims of one of auxiliary requests 1 to 8 as filed by letter dated 29 August 2016.\n\nThe respondent further requested a different apportionment of costs, i.e. that its preparation costs for the oral proceedings be borne by appellant 3.\n\nXIII. The appellants' arguments, insofar as they are relevant to the present decision, are summarised as follows:\n\n- Each of documents D1 and D2 might equally represent the closest prior art for the claimed subject-matter.\n\n- D1 disclosed compounds falling under Formula (I) of claim 1 as granted, especially compound 66, as ALK and NPM-ALK inhibitors, to be used for treating various forms of cancer, in particular lung cancer.\n\n- Starting from D1, the objective technical problem was to provide a further use of compound 66.\n\n- It was known from all documents D2, D3, D4, D7, D14 and D15 that ALK inhibitors were used for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. On the basis of this overwhelming teaching, the skilled person would have expected compound 66 of D1 to also show inhibition of EML4-ALK in EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. The claimed use was thus not inventive when starting from D1.\n\n- Document D2 disclosed the use of an ALK inhibitor, compound TAE684, for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC.\n\n- Starting from D2, the objective technical problem was to provide alternative inhibitors of EML4-ALK for the treatment of NSCLC.\n\n- It was common general knowledge that ALK inhibitors were used for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. D1 disclosed compound 66, falling under claim 1 at issue, as an ALK and NPM-ALK inhibitor. Compound 66 was structurally very similar to TAE684. Thus, the skilled person would have had a reasonable expectation of success when replacing TAE684 of D2 with compound 66 of D1. Therefore, the claimed use was not inventive when starting from D2 either.\n\nXIV. The respondent's arguments, insofar as they are relevant to the present decision, are summarised as follows:\n\n- Starting from compound 66 of D1 as the closest prior art, the objective technical problem was to provide a further use.\n\n- No activity of compound 66 had been tested in D1. D1 only disclosed a very long list of compounds, without specifying which compound of this list was active against which target. The skilled person would not have inferred from the disclosure in D1 that compound 66 had inhibitory activity against ALK or NPM-ALK.\n\n- Therefore, the fact that other documents disclosed ALK inhibitors for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC would not have prompted the skilled person to use compound 66 of D1 for this purpose. Structural similarity was no guarantee of similar activity. Therefore, it had to be concluded that claim 1 involved an inventive step when starting from D1.\n\n- Even if, starting from D2, the objective technical problem was the provision of alternative compounds for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC, the subject-matter of claim 1 would still be inventive.\n\n- D2 compared the specific and selective EML4-ALK inhibitor TAE684 with the non-specific ALK inhibitor crizotinib and concluded that TAE684 was much more potent. In view of this disclosure, the skilled person would not have expected that other non-specific ALK inhibitors could replace TAE684, let alone compound 66 of D1. In particular, structural similarity was no guarantee of similar activity.\n\n- Therefore, it had to be concluded that claim 1 involved an inventive step also when starting from D2.\n\nApportionment of costs\n\n- Appellant 3's announcement of non-attendance at the oral proceedings only the evening before the hearing had generated additional costs for the respondent, since the oral proceedings could have been cancelled if this announcement had been made earlier.\n\n- This behaviour justified a different apportionment of costs.",
         "Reasons for the Decision\n\nAppellants' non-attendance at the oral proceedings\n\nAppellants 1 to 3 were duly summoned but did not attend the oral proceedings. In accordance with Rule 115(2) EPC and Article 15(3) RPBA 2020, the board decided to continue the proceedings in the appellants' absence and the appellants were treated as relying on their written case. Hence, the board was in a position to announce a decision at the conclusion of the oral proceedings in accordance with Article 15(6) RPBA 2020.\n\nMain request - the patent as granted - claim 1\n\nGround for opposition under Article 100(a) EPC - inventive step under Article 56 EPC\n\n1. The invention as defined in claim 1 as granted (point II above) concerns the compounds of Formula (I) for use in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being positive, i.e. harbouring the fusion gene EML4-ALK, i.e. the gene resulting from the fusion of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. Exemplary compounds falling under the claimed Formula (I) are shown as compounds 1 to 6 on pages 3 and 4 of the patent.\n\nThe appellants submitted that both documents D1 and D2 might each represent the closest prior art for the claimed subject-matter.\n\n2. Document D1\n\n2.1 D1 discloses (paragraphs [0018] and [0019]) compounds of formulae (1), (2), (3A), (3B), (4A), (4B) and (5) (see pages 2 to 8) said to potentially inhibit kinases such as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase (ZAP-70) as well as insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), found to be implicated in cancer diseases, including lung tumours. Additionally, D1 discloses (paragraphs [0040] to [0042]) that compounds of said formulae may inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of the fusion protein of ALK and nucleophosmin (NPM-ALK), whereby NPM-ALK had been identified in neoplastic diseases.\n\nIn table 1 (page 60 to page 129), D1 discloses exemplary compounds 1 to 246 according to the disclosed formulae. Among these, compounds 66, 131 and 181 correspond to compounds 1, 5 and 6 as defined in the patent (table on page 3, claim 5). In particular, compound 66 has been indicated by the appellants as the closest prior art. Its structure is shown below:\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nThe respondent did not agree that D1 and especially compound 66 disclosed therein could represent the closest prior art. In light of the considerations set out below, there was no need for the board to consider this issue further. Therefore, in the appellants' favour, the board assumes in the following that compound 66 can indeed be taken as the starting point for the assessment of inventive step of the claimed subject-matter.\n\nThe distinguishing feature\n\n2.2 Compound 66 falls under Formula (I) of claim 1 (compound 1 in the table on page 3 of the patent). Given the disclosure of D1 as set out above, the subject-matter of claim 1 as granted differs from the disclosure of D1 in that compound 66 is used for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC.\n\nThe objective technical problem\n\n2.3 In view of the above-identified distinguishing feature, the objective technical problem, as submitted by the appellants, lies in the provision of a further therapeutic use of compound 66 of D1.\n\nObviousness of the claimed solution\n\n2.4 The appellants argued that D1 taught that compounds falling under claim 1 as granted, especially compound 66, were active as ALK and NPM-ALK inhibitors for treating, inter alia, lung tumours. The appellants further regarded document D3 as a seminal paper, forming part of common general knowledge. D3 explained on page 562, right-hand column, that EML4-ALK was an oncogene with transforming activity dependent on its kinase activity. According to D3, on the basis of this finding, ALK inhibitors should have been able to suppress growth of cells expressing fusion proteins of ALK, inter alia NPM-ALK and EML4-ALK. The tests reported in D3 confirmed this assumption, showing that an ALK inhibitor, WHI-P154, inhibited the growth of cells expressing EML4-ALK. This teaching of D3 was confirmed in all documents D2, D4, D7, D14 and D15, which all disclosed the use of ALK inhibitors for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. On the basis of this overwhelming teaching, the skilled person would have expected compound 66, identified in D1 as an ALK and NPM-ALK inhibitor, to also show inhibition of EML4-ALK in EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. This reasonable expectation of success was further corroborated by the structural similarity between compound 66 of D1 and compound TAE684 used in D2 for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. These two compounds belonged to the same family, as TAE684 had been used as a starting compound for the development of compound 66, as disclosed in document D10 on page 5675. The claimed subject-matter was thus obvious.\n\n2.5 The board disagrees for the following reasons.\n\n2.5.1 It is acknowledged that all documents D2, D3, D4, D7, D14 and D15 (D2: abstract, discussion on pages 8 to 10; D3: pages 564 and 565; D4: \"Discussion\" on pages 1700 to 1702; D7: abstract, pages 19894 and 19897; D14: \"Introduction\" on pages 4247 and 4248 as well as on pages 4251 to 4253; D15: abstract, \"Introduction\" on pages 1773 to 1774 and page 1778) disclose the use of ALK inhibitors for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. However, D1, contrary to the appellants' view, does not disclose that compounds falling under claim 1 at issue, especially compound 66, are ALK or NPM-ALK inhibitors. As pointed out by the respondent during oral proceedings, D1 merely discloses (paragraphs [0040], [0042], [0047], [0049] and [0050]) that compounds covered by various formulae (1), (2), (3A), (3B), (4A), (4B) and (5) \"may inhibit\" (emphasis added by the board) various different targets, namely ALK, NPM-ALK, FAK, ZAP-70 and/or IGF-1, said to be implicated in neoplastic diseases. Moreover, a number of other potential medical uses of the disclosed compounds are mentioned in paragraph [0051]. Although tests for assessing the ability of the disclosed compounds to inhibit ALK and NPM-ALK are mentioned in D1 (paragraphs [0043] to [0046] and [0143] to [0151]), no such tests were performed on the disclosed compounds, let alone on the specific compound 66. Therefore, no disclosure is present in D1 as regards which of the disclosed compounds is active against which target. Hence, the starting point of the appellants' argumentation, namely that D1 discloses compound 66 as an ALK and NPM-ALK inhibitor, is not correct.\n\n2.5.2 Starting again from the assumption that D1 taught that compound 66 was active against ALK and NPM-ALK, appellant 2 argued that, contrary to the finding in the opposition division's decision, it would have been credible that compound 66 did indeed provide this effect of acting against ALK and NPM-ALK. Appellant 2 argued that it would have been obvious to the skilled person to perform the tests indicated in D1. The skilled person had to be able to perform obvious tests to confirm the teaching of a prior-art document, just as an applicant or patentee could file the results of tests carried out after the filing date to confirm the teaching of the application as filed. In doing such tests, the skilled person would have verified that compound 66 exhibited activity against ALK. The post-published document D29 in the name of the respondent did indeed confirm the ALK inhibitory activity of compound 66.\n\n2.5.3 However, the board notes that, for the same reasons as given above, the starting point chosen by appellant 2 for its line of argument is not correct. D1 does not disclose that compound 66 is active against ALK or NPM-ALK. Therefore, the question as to whether this activity is credible does not arise. For this reason alone, the appellant 2's argument must fail. Furthermore, when assessing the content of a prior-art document, only the actual disclosure is to be considered, i.e. what the skilled person would derive, explicitly or implicitly, but directly and unambiguously, using common general knowledge, from the document as a whole. Supplementing an actual disclosure, such as that of D1, with additional information, such as that of document D29 that had been made available to the public only after the filing date of the patent in suit, is not permitted, no matter how obvious such additional information may turn out to be. Since the ALK inhibitory activity tests reported in D29 are not part of the disclosure of D1, either implicitly or explicitly, they cannot be considered when assessing inventive step starting from the disclosure of D1.\n\n2.5.4 Thus, D1 does not disclose that compound 66 shows ALK or NPM-ALK inhibitory activity. Therefore, even accepting in the appellants' favour that documents D2, D3, D4, D7, D14 and D15 disclose that ALK inhibitors can be used to treat EML4-ALK positive NSCLC, the skilled person would not have been prompted by any one of these documents to apply the teaching contained therein to compound 66 of D1, i.e. to use this compound for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC.\n\n2.5.5 Also, the alleged structural similarity between compound 66 (point 2.1 above) and TAE684, the ALK inhibitor used in D2 (loc. cit.) for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC, would not have prompted the skilled person to use compound 66 for the same purpose either. The structure of TAE684 is shown below:\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nEven if some similarities are indeed present, the structures of the two compounds differ in many aspects, as evident from the figures shown above. Moreover, as pointed out by the respondent, no evidence has been presented that a similar structure would also result in a similar inhibitory activity. In fact, the evidence on file shows that the structures of the compounds disclosed in D2 (TAE684), D3 (WHI-P154), D4 (Crizotinib), D7 (compound 3-39 according to WO 2005/016894), D14 (Crizotinib) and D15 (Crizotinib) as ALK and EML4-ALK inhibitors are widely different, as shown by the figures below:\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC         FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nALK inhibitor according to D7,\n\nwherein Rx is  FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC\n\nTherefore, no link can be established between the structure of a compound and its ALK inhibitory activity.\n\nAs regards D10, invoked by the appellants to allege that TAE684 had been used to develop compound 66, it is noted that D10 is a document published after the filing date of the patent in suit. Therefore, the development disclosed therein does not represent prior art available to the skilled person.\n\n2.6 For the reasons set out above, the board concludes that the subject-matter of claim 1 involves an inventive step when starting from D1 as the closest prior art (Article 56 EPC).\n\n3. Document D2\n\n3.1 D2 discloses (loc. cit.) the use of the ALK inhibiting compound TAE684 for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. D2 thus discloses the same therapeutic application as defined in claim 1 as granted. The parties were in agreement that D2 could be taken as a starting point for assessing inventive step.\n\nThe distinguishing feature\n\n3.2 It was common ground that the subject-matter of claim 1 as granted differs from the disclosure of D2 in that compounds of Formula (I), rather than compound TAE684 of D2, are used for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC.\n\nThe objective technical problem\n\n3.3 However, the views of the parties diverged as far as the objective technical problem deriving from this distinguishing feature is concerned.\n\nThe appellants argued that no technical effect derived from the above-mentioned distinguishing feature and, thus, that the objective technical problem lay in the provision of alternative inhibitors of EML4-ALK for the treatment of EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. In light of the conclusions below, there was no need for the board in the present case to establish whether or not a particular technical effect is associated with the distinguishing feature. The board therefore assumes in the following that the formulation of the objective technical problem is as suggested by the appellants.\n\nObviousness of the claimed solution\n\n3.4 The appellants argued that D1 disclosed compounds falling under claim 1 as granted, especially compound 66, that were said to be ALK and NPM-ALK inhibitors. It was known in the prior art, from e.g. D3 and D4, that ALK inhibitors also inhibited ALK fusion proteins, especially EML4-ALK. It was also known, from e.g. D7, D14 and D15, that ALK inhibitors might be used for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. Based on this common general knowledge, the skilled person seeking a solution to the technical problem posed would have had a reasonable expectation of success when using compound 66 for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. This applied also in view of the similarity between the structures of TAE684 used in D2 and compound 66 of D1. Indeed, these two compounds belonged to the same family since TAE684 had been used as a starting compound for the development of compound 66, as disclosed in document D10 on page 5675. The subject-matter of claim 1 was thus obvious in view of D2 in combination with D1.\n\n3.5 The board disagrees for the following reasons.\n\n3.5.1 As already mentioned under point 2.5 above, D1 does not report any activity of the disclosed compounds, let alone of compound 66, and let alone an inhibitory activity of this specific compound against ALK or NPM-ALK. As also set out above, there is no evidence that structural similarity would have resulted in a similar inhibitory activity. Furthermore, document D10, being post-published, is not prior art available to the skilled person. Thus, the skilled person would not have turned to D1 when aiming to solve the technical problem posed, but would have instead considered any one of documents D3, D4, D7, D14 and D15, all disclosing compounds used for treating EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. However, in doing this, the skilled person would not have arrived at the claimed subject-matter, as none of these compounds falls under claim 1 at issue.\n\n3.5.2 Even assuming that the skilled person had considered D1, the skilled person would have found in paragraph [0047] the indication that FAK, rather than ALK inhibitors, may be useful in treating NSCLC. This indication would, likewise, not have pointed to any specific compound, let alone compound 66, as FAK inhibitory activity was not tested in D1 for any of the disclosed compounds.\n\n3.6 Therefore, the board concludes that, even with the assumption in the appellants' favour that no technical effect would be associated with the feature distinguishing claim 1 from D2, the subject-matter of claim 1 involves an inventive step when starting from D2 as the closest prior art (Article 56 EPC).\n\n3.7 The respondent, in defending inventive step over D2, relied on D10 to show the presence of a technical effect of the feature distinguishing claim 1 from D2. The appellants did not agree that the post-published document D10 should be taken into account to prove this effect.\n\nHowever, since the board reached the above conclusion in favour of an inventive step of the subject-matter of claim 1 even assuming that no technical effect of the feature distinguishing claim 1 from D2 was present, it did not need to decide whether document D10 could be taken into account.\n\nConclusion\n\n4. For the reasons set out above, the subject-matter of claim 1 as granted involves an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC. The same applies to the subject-matter of claims 2 to 8, dependent on claim 1, and to the subject-matter of claim 9, defining the same medical use as claim 1 in the Swiss-type format. The subject-matter of claims 2 to 9 also involves an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).\n\nIt follows that the ground for opposition under Article 100(a) EPC in combination with Article 56 EPC does not prejudice the maintenance of the patent as granted.\n\nTherefore, the main request of the respondent is allowable.\n\nRequest for a different apportionment of costs\n\n5. During oral proceedings, the respondent requested that the costs incurred by it for preparing the oral proceedings be borne by appellant 3. It was submitted that, while appellants 1 and 2 had announced their non-attendance at the oral proceedings well in advance, the remaining appellant 3 indicated its non-attendance only the evening before the hearing. Therefore, the board had not been given any opportunity to form an opinion on the case at an earlier point in time and to possibly cancel the oral proceedings.\n\nMoreover, appellant 3 had spoken in French at the oral proceedings before the opposition division and all letters filed during the appeal proceedings were also written in French. The fact that appellant 3 had informed the board of its intention to speak English at the oral proceedings was an indication that it had probably already considered, at that point in time, not attending the oral proceedings, but wanted to avoid translation costs in the event of deciding not to attend at the very last minute.\n\nA different apportionment of costs was thus justified.\n\n6. The board disagrees for the following reasons:\n\n6.1 Under Article 104(1) EPC and Article 16(1) RPBA 2020, each party to the appeal proceedings bears the costs that it has incurred, unless the board, for reasons of equity, orders a different apportionment of costs. Reasons of equity may arise if the procedural behaviour of a party generates disadvantages to other parties to the proceedings, in particular in situations set out in Article 16(1) RPBA 2020.\n\n6.2 In the present case, the appellant 3's announcement of non-attendance at the oral proceedings was filed at an extremely late stage, namely roughly twelve hours before the start of the oral proceedings, without any justification for this late filing. It is no more than the usual degree of courtesy owed to a board of appeal as a court of final appellate jurisdiction and to the other parties for a party's intention not to attend the oral proceedings to be communicated as early as possible (see also decision T 13/19, reasons, point 1.3).\n\n6.3 However, no causal link can be established between appellant 3's procedural behaviour and any additional costs incurred by the respondent, namely additional preparation costs as argued by the respondent. It can be noted that the board's communication under Article 15(1) RPBA did not contain a preliminary opinion of the board concerning the appeals, in particular concerning inventive step, in favour of the respondent. Instead, the board (points 5.3.3 and 5.5 of said communication) expressed the opinion that the issue of inventive step had to be discussed at the oral proceedings. Therefore, it cannot be deduced from the board's communication that no oral proceedings would have been necessary, had all appellants announced their non-attendance at such oral proceedings well in advance and even assuming that their announcements of non-attendance had been considered as withdrawals of their requests for oral proceedings. In fact, a possible cancellation of the oral proceedings in the event of appellant 3 having announced its non-attendance at an earlier point in time would have entirely depended on the board's dealing with the case and the timing of its deliberations. Additionally, the respondent itself (reply to the appeals, page 2, point 1) had requested oral proceedings in the event of the main request not being granted. Thus, this request was not conditional on the presence of the appellants at oral proceedings and remained pending until the final decision on the main request was taken by the board in the oral proceedings. Thus, independently of the behaviour of appellant 3, the respondent would have had to prepare for a discussion of its case at the oral proceedings anyway. The board therefore does not consider it equitable to order a different apportionment of costs in the circumstances of the present case.\n\n6.4 As regards the French language being used by appellant 3 in its letters, on the one hand, and the announcement of its intention to plead in English on the other, the board notes that the parties are free to use any one of the official languages - see Rule 3(1) and Rule 4(1) EPC. The reasons as to why a different language, here English as the language of the proceedings, is intended to be used at the oral proceedings can be manifold. For instance, the person who plans to attend the oral proceedings may either prefer to plead in the language of the proceedings, or may at least accept this, considering that interpretation would likely have to be arranged by the EPO otherwise, resulting in additional human and financial resources on the part of the EPO and additional complexity for the hearing. A further reason may be that the attendee is aware that a particular hearing format might not be available where interpretation is required. Therefore, the board is far from seeing any misuse of the procedure by appellant 3 in its announcement that it would use the language of the proceedings at the hearing. It can also be noted in this context that the persons whose attendance was initially announced were not the persons attending the oral proceedings in opposition on behalf of appellant 3, as can be derived from the minutes of the opposition division. The respondent's argument that the change in the language to be used by appellant 3 implied that it intended, already well in advance, to be absent from the oral proceedings is nothing but speculation that, without proper substantiation, has to be disregarded.\n\n6.5 For the reasons set out above, the board rejected the respondent's request for a different apportionment of costs.",
